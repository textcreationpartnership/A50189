            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALthough I was not altogether negligent, in Noting down such Occurrenecs, respecting the present <hi>War</hi> with the Heathen in <hi>New-England,</hi> as came to my knowledg, in the time of them; yet what I did that way, was meerly for my own private use; nor had I the least thought of publishing any of my <hi>Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> until such time as I read a <hi>Narrative</hi> of this <hi>War,</hi> said to be Written by a Merchant in <hi>Boston,</hi> which it seems met with an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>December</hi> last: The abounding Mistakes therein, caused me to think it necessary, that a true <hi>History</hi> of this Affair should be Published. Wherefore I resolved (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>) to <hi>Methodize</hi> such scattered <hi>Observations</hi> as I had by me, so were the <hi>Horae subsecivae</hi> of a few days improved. Whilst I was doing this, there came to my hands another <hi>Narrative</hi> of this War, written by a <hi>Quaker</hi> in <hi>Road-Island,</hi> who pretends to know the Truth of things; but that Narrative being fraught with worse things than <hi>meer Mistakes,</hi> I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by quickned to expedite what I had in hand. I moved that some other might have done it, but none presenting, I thought of his saying, <hi>Ab alio quovis hoc fieri mallem quÃ m Ã  me, sed Ã  me tamen potius quÃ m Ã  nemine.</hi> And I hope that in one thing, (though it may be in little else) I have performed the part of an <hi>Historian, viz.</hi> In endeavouring to relate things truly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, and doing the best I could that I might not lead the <hi>Reader</hi> into a Mistake. <hi>History</hi> is indeed in it self a profitable study. Learned Men know that <hi>Polybius,</hi> and the great Philosopher call it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>. And there is holy Scripture to encourage a work of this nature; For what was the <hi>Book of the Wars of the Lord?</hi> Num. 21. 14. And that Book of <hi>Jasher,</hi> which we read of in <hi>Joshua</hi> and in <hi>Samuel?</hi> Yea, and the Book of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> mentioned in the Book of <hi>Kings</hi> (for we find not some of those things referred unto in the <hi>Canonical</hi> Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi>). What were these Books, but the faithful <hi>Records</hi> of the Providential Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, in the days of old? Yea, and it is proper for the Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sters of God, to ingage themselves in Services of this nature; Witness the <hi>History,</hi> or <hi>Commentary <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> of the Prophet Iddo,</hi> 2â–ª Chro. 13. 22. Whether my defective manner of management in this History renders it unprofitable, I know not. Consid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ring the other employments that are always upon me, together
<pb facs="tcp:40970:4"/> with my personal inabilities, I have cause to suspect it may be so, in a great measure. If any one shall hereby be incited to do better, I hope I shall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thank than envy him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>. And I earnestly wish that some effectual Course may be taken (before it be too late) that a just <hi>History of New-England,</hi> be written and published to the World. That is a thing that hath been often spoken of, but was never done to this day, and yet the longer it is deferred, the more difficulty will there be in effecting of it.</p>
            <p>Moreover the thing which I mainly designed, was the subsequent <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,</hi> which is annexed herewith, wherein I have desired to approve my self as in the sight of God, speaking what I believe God would have me to speak, without respect to any person in this world. And there is one thing insisted on therein, concerning which I could wish that I had said more, I mean that which doth respect endeavours for the <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi> unto Christ. There are some that make a wrong use of a Notion of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> touching this matter, alledging that he taught that a general <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> of <hi>Indians</hi> is not to be expected before the seven Vials are poured forth upon the Antichristian State, nor before the conversion of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation. It is far from my purpose to contradict that <hi>Great Author,</hi> unto whose dust (in respect of near Affinity as well as on the account of his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in Grace and spiritual Gifts) I ow a sacred Reverence, and it is known that I have my self asserted the same Notion both in Sermons, and in a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Discourse concerning the Salvation of the Tribes of Israel.</hi> But it was never intended that that Assertion should be improved, so as to discourage from the prosecution of that which was the professed, pious, and a main design of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of this <hi>Colony;</hi> viz. <hi>To propagate the Gospel and Kingdom of Christ among these</hi> Indians, <hi>who in former Ages had not heard of his fame and Glory.</hi> It is indeed true, that although a <hi>Fulness of the Gentiles</hi> in respect of <hi>Apostasy,</hi> shal be accomplished (so must they <hi>fulfill their Times</hi>) before the calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet the fulness of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in respect of <hi>Conversion,</hi> will not come in before that. Nevertheless a glorious Sprinkling, and great success of the Gospel may be in particular places at present, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Heathen. And the Salvation of a few immortal Souls is worth the labour of many all their lives. And happy experience hath confirmed this; for here in <hi>New-England,</hi> six Churches have been constituted amongst the <hi>Indians.</hi> And the labours of <hi>Robert Junius</hi> forty years since a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>East-Indians</hi> in <hi>Formosa,</hi> were wonderfully successful; for (as <hi>Caspar Sibellius,</hi> Pastor of the Church in <hi>Daventry</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> writing the History of that affair doth relate) there were no less than five thousand and nine hundred <hi>Indians</hi> that became professedly subject to the Gospel, and
<pb facs="tcp:40970:4"/> were all, together with their children, baptized into the Name of <hi>Jesus Christ. Junius</hi> having learned the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, and being a Man of exemplary Piety in his conversation, and one also that excelled in wisdom and spiritual Abilities, God was with him, and made him an happy Instrument of wining Souls. He Translated some part of the Scripture, and wrote Catechisms, and other profitable Books in their Language. He caused Schools to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected among those blind <hi>Barbarians,</hi> so as that <hi>six hundred</hi> of them were able to read and write, and about <hi>fifty</hi> who excelled in knowledg, and were of approved godliness, became <hi>Instructors</hi> of others in the Principles of the true Christian Religion: Yea, in <hi>three and twenty Towns,</hi> there were <hi>Indian</hi> Christian <hi>Churches Planted.</hi> And learned Men were sent out of <hi>Holland,</hi> in order to a further propagation of the interest of the Gospel in those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the World. Also <hi>Justus Heurnius,</hi> who was at first a <hi>Physitian,</hi> being inflamed with a singular, zeal after Gods Glory, and the Salvation of Souls of Men, left his practising in <hi>Medicinal Cures,</hi> and betook himself wholly to the study of <hi>Divinity;</hi> after which he engaged in a Voyage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>East-Indians,</hi> designing their <hi>Conversion;</hi> and having learned their <hi>Language,</hi> spent fourteen Years amongst them: and as the great <hi>Voetius</hi> (in his Disputation, <hi>De Vocatione Gentium</hi>) testifieth, was instrumental to the <hi>Conversion</hi> of many of those <hi>Indians,</hi> so as to erect <hi>Churches</hi> of them in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, yea, and took care for the <hi>learned Education</hi> of divers Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, even amongst the <hi>Indians</hi> themselves, so as that they were able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the several Churches, which by the blessing of God upon his Labours had been lately formed. It is great pity then, that we in <hi>New-England,</hi> who do not come behind others in Profession, and Pretences to Religion, should fall short in real endeavours, for the promotion and propagation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Christianity amongst those that have been for ages that are past, <hi>without God, and without Christ, and Strangers to the Common-wealth of Israel.</hi> It troubleth me, when I read how the <hi>Papists</hi> glory in that they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted so many of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>Westâ–ª Indians</hi> to the Christian Faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach <hi>Protestants,</hi> because they have been no more industrious in a work of that nature. Though I know they have little cause to Glory, if the whole truth were known. For as for many of their <hi>Converts,</hi> inasmuch as they are become <hi>Vassals,</hi> not only to the Heresies, but to the Persons of those who have Proselyted them, they are as Christ said concerning the Proselytes of the Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>twofold more the children of Hell,</hi> than they were before; and many of them know little of <hi>Christianity</hi> besides the <hi>Name.</hi> Witness the celebrated Story of that <hi>Franciscan,</hi> who wrote a Letter to a Friend of his in <hi>Europe,</hi> wherein he glorieth that having lived six and twenty years amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> he had converted many thousands of them to the
<pb facs="tcp:40970:5"/> Faith, and he desired his Friend to send him a Book called the <hi>Bible,</hi> for he heard there was such a Book in <hi>Europe,</hi> which might be of some use to him. Surely, <hi>Francis</hi> himself did not excel this <hi>Franciscan,</hi> in profound ignorance. It is also true, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have formerly (as was in part intimated but now) done something towards the <hi>Conversion</hi> of those <hi>Indians</hi> where they have Plantations settled. For they have caused some part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be Translated into the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, and have out of their publick Treasuries maintained some Learned and meet Persons, on purpose, that they might become <hi>Preachers to the Indians:</hi> Nevertheless, <hi>Voetius</hi> in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertation <hi>de plantatoribus Ecclesiarum,</hi> greatly bewaileth it, that no more care hath been taken about that concern of the Gospel and Kingdom of Christ; and declareth what were the unhappy obstructions, hindring the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, from attaining a further progress in a work so desirable; but (as he there speaketh) <hi>Infanda illa nihil attinet hie referre.</hi> And I know not, but that the Lords holy Design in the <hi>War</hi> which he hath brought upon us, may (in part) be to punish us for our too great neglect in this matter. I would not detract from what hath been done that way, but rather with my Soul bless God for it. It is well known, that sundry of the Lords Servants in this Land, have laboured in that work: Especially Reverend Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> hath taken most indefatigable pains, having Translated the whole Bible into the <hi>Indian Language,</hi> in which respect <hi>New-England</hi> (let Christ alone have the praise of it) hath out-done all other places, so far as I have heard or read. But it cannot be long, before that faithful, and now aged Servant of the Lord rest from his Labours: Sad will it be for the succeeding Generation, if they shall suffer the Work of Christ amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> to die with him who began it. <hi>Sed meliora speramus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall add no more, but leave the success of this undertaking to him, who alone can give it. And I earnestly desire the Prayers of every Godly Reader.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE VVAR WITH THE INDIANS IN NEW-ENGLAND.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THAT the Heathen People amongst whom we live, and whose Land the Lord God of our Fathers hath given to us for a rightful Possession, have at sundry times been Plotting mischievous Devices against that part of the <hi>English Israel,</hi> which is seated in these goings down of the Sun, no man that is an Inhabitant of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable standing, can be ignorant. Especially that there have been (<hi>Nec injuria</hi>) Jealousies concerning the <hi>Narragansets</hi> and <hi>Wompanoags,</hi> is notoriously known to all men. And whereas they have been quiet until the last Year, that must be ascribed to the wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, who did (as with <hi>Jacob</hi> of old, and after that with the Children of <hi>Israel</hi>) lay the fear of the <hi>English,</hi> and the dread of them upon all the <hi>Indians.</hi> The terror of God was upon them round about. Nor indeed had they such Advantages in former Years as now they have, in respect of Arms and Ammunition; their Bows and Arrows not being comparably such weapons of death and destruction, as our Guns and Swords are, with which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40970:6"/> they have been unhappily furnished. Nor were our sins ripe for so dreadful a Judgment, until <hi>the Body of the first Generation</hi> was removed, and another Generation risen up which hath not so pursued, as ought to have been, the blessed design of their Fathers, in following the Lord into this Wilderness, whilst it was a Land not sown.</p>
               <p>As for the Grounds, Justness, and Necessity of the present <hi>War</hi> with these Barbarous Creatures which have set upon us, my<note place="margin">Read the Postscript at the end of this History.</note> design is not to <hi>intarge</hi> upon that Argument, but to leave that to others whom it mostly concerns, only in brief this. The irruption of this flame at this time was occasioned as followeth.</p>
               <p>In the latter end of the Year 1674. An <hi>Indian,</hi> called <hi>John Sausaman,</hi> who had submitted himself unto, and was taken under the protection of the <hi>English,</hi> perceiving that the <hi>profane Indians</hi> were hatching mischief against the <hi>English,</hi> he faithfully acquainted the Governor of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> with what he knew, and also what his fears were, together with the grounds thereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al declaring; that he doubted such and such <hi>Indians</hi> belonging to <hi>Philip</hi> the Sachem of <hi>Pokanoket,</hi> or <hi>Mount-hope,</hi> would murder him; which quickly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned accordingly: For soon after this, <hi>John Sausaman</hi> was barbarously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by an <hi>Indian,</hi> called <hi>Tobias</hi> (one of <hi>Philip</hi>'s chief Captains and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellors) and by his Son, and another <hi>Indian,</hi> who knocked him on the head and then left him on the Ice on a great Pond. Divine providence, which useth to bring Murder to light, so ordered, as that an <hi>Indian</hi> unseen by those three that killed <hi>Sausaman,</hi> beheld all that they did to him, and spake of it, so as that a <hi>Praying</hi> (and as there is cause to hope) a godly <hi>Indian, William Nabauton</hi> by name, heard of it, and he forth with revealed what he knew to the <hi>English.</hi> Whereupon the three <hi>Indians</hi> who had committed the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were apprehended, and the other <hi>Indian</hi> testified to their faces, that he saw them killing <hi>Sausaman.</hi> They had a fair T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>yal for their Lives, and that no appearance of wrong might be, <hi>Indians</hi> as well as <hi>English</hi> sate upon the <hi>Jury,</hi> and all agreed to the condemnation of those Murtherers, who were accordiugly Executed in the beginning of the <hi>4th</hi> Month called <hi>June,</hi> Anno 1675. They stoutly denied the Fact, only at last <hi>Tobias</hi>'s son confessed, that his Father and the other <hi>Indian</hi> killed <hi>Sausaman,</hi> but that himself had no hand in it, only stood by and saw them do it.</p>
               <p>No doubt but one reason why the <hi>Indians</hi> murdered <hi>John Sausaman,</hi> was out of hatred against him for his Religion, for he was Christianized and babtiz'd, and was a Preacher amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> being of very excellent parts, he t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> to curb those <hi>Indians</hi> that knew not God, on the account of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries; but the main ground why they murthered him seems to be, because he discovered their subtle and malicious designs, which they were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40970:6"/> complotting against the <hi>English. Philip</hi> perceiving that the Court of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> had Condemned and Executed one of his Counsellors, being (as is upon strong grounds supposed) conscious of the murder committed upon <hi>John Sausaman,</hi> must needs think that ere long, they would do to him (who had no less deserved it) as they had done to his Counsellor: Wherefore he, contrary to his Covenant and Faith engaged to <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony, yea, and contrary to his promise unto some in this Colony (for about five Years ago, <hi>Philip</hi> made a disturbance in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony, but was quieted by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent interposition of some in our Colony, when he engaged, that if at any time hereafter he should think the <hi>English</hi> among whom he lived did him wrong, he would not cause any Disquietment before such time as he had acquainted the <hi>English</hi> of <hi>Mattachusets,</hi> but contrary to these solemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he) doth call his Men together and <hi>Arm</hi> them, and refused to come when sent for, by the Authority of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> unto whose Government he had subjected himself.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the <hi>English</hi> in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Jurisdiction, sent a small <hi>Army</hi> to those Towns next <hi>Mount-hope,</hi> in order to reducing <hi>Philip</hi> to his obedience, and for the security of those places which were in great danger, and in no less fear, by reason of the insolency of the Heathen.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 24. (Midsummer-day) was appointed and attended as a day of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Humiliation throughout that Colony, by fasting and praying, to intreat the Lord to give success to the present Expedition respecting the Enemy. At the conclusion of that day of Humiliation, as soon as ever the People in <hi>Swanzy</hi> were come from the place where they had been praying together, the <hi>Indians</hi> discharged a volley of shot, whereby they killed one man, and wounded others. Two men were sent to call a Surgeon for the relief of the wounded, but the <hi>Indians</hi> killed them by the way: And in another part of the Town, six men were killed, so that there were Nine <hi>Englishmen</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered this day.</p>
               <p>Thus did the <hi>War</hi> begin, this being the first English blood which was spilt by the <hi>Indians</hi> in an Hostile way. The Providence of God is deeply to be observed, that the Sword should be first drawn upon a day of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Lord thereby declaring from Heaven, that he expects something else from his People besides Fasting and Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plymouth</hi> being thus suddenly involved in trouble, send to the other uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Colonies for aid, and their desires were with all readiness complied with.</p>
               <p>Souldiers marched out of <hi>Boston</hi> towards <hi>Mount-hope,</hi> June <hi>26th,</hi> and continued marching that night, when there hapned a great Eclipse of the Moon, which was totally darkned above an hour. Only it must be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40970:7"/> that some days before any Souldiers went out of <hi>Boston,</hi> Commissioners were sent to Treat with <hi>Philip,</hi> that so if possible, ingaging in a War might be prevented. But when the Commissioners came near to <hi>Mount-hope,</hi> they found divers <hi>Englishmen</hi> on the ground, weltering in their own blood, having been newly murdered by the <hi>Indians,</hi> so that they could not proceed further. Yea, the <hi>Indians</hi> killed a man of this Colony as he was travelling on the road before such time as we took up Arms: In which respect no man can doubt of the <hi>justness</hi> of our Cause, since the Enemy did shed the blood of some of ours who never did them (our Enemies themselves being judges) the least wrong before we did at all offend them, or attempt any act of hostility towards them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>
                  <hi>June 29th</hi> was a day of publick <hi>Humiliation</hi> in this Colony, appointed by the Council, in respect of the <hi>War</hi> which is now begun.</p>
               <p>This morning our Army would have ingaged with the Enemy. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> shot the Pilot, who was directing our Souldiers in their way to <hi>Philips</hi> Country, and wounded several of our Men, and ran into Swamps, rainy weather hindred a further pursuit of the Enemy. An awful Providence happened at this time: For a Souldier (a stout man) who was sent from <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-town,</hi> seeing the <hi>English Guide</hi> slain, and hearing many profane oaths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong some of our Souldiers (namely those Privateers, who were also Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers) and considering the unseasonableness of the weather was such, as that nothing could be done against the Enemy; this man was possessed with a strong conceit, that God was against the <hi>English;</hi> whereupon he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ran distracted, and so was returned home a lamentable Spectacle.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> there was another Skirmish with the Enemy, wherein several of the <hi>Indians</hi> were killed, amongst whom were <hi>Philips</hi> chief Captain, and one of his Counsellors.</p>
               <p>Now it appears that <hi>Squaw-Sachem</hi> of <hi>Pocasset,</hi> her men were conjoyned with the <hi>Womponoags</hi> (that is <hi>Philips</hi> men) in this Rebellion.</p>
               <p>About this time they killed several <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Taunton,</hi> and Burnt divers Houses there. Also at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> they caused about half the Town to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed with merciless Flames. Likewise <hi>Middlebury</hi> and <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> in <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Colony, did they burn with Fire, and barbarously murdered both men and women in those places, stripping the slain, whether Men or Women, and leaving them in the open Field, as naked as in the day wherein they were born. Such also is their Inhumanity, as that they flay off the skin from their Faces and Heads of those they get into their hands, and go away with the hairy Scalp of their Enemies.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 19. Our Army pursued <hi>Philip,</hi> who fled unto a dismal Swamp for refuge: The <hi>English Souldiers</hi> followed him, and killed many of his men, also about fifteen of the <hi>English</hi> were then slain. The Swamp was so Boggy,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40970:7"/> and thick of Bushes, as that it was judged to proceed further therein would be but to throw away Mens lives. It could not there be discerned who were <hi>English,</hi> and who the <hi>Indians.</hi> Our Men when in that hideous place if they did but see a Bush stir would fire presently, whereby 'tis verily feared, that they did sometimes unhappily shoot <hi>English Men</hi> instead of <hi>Indians.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Retreat</hi> was sounded, and night coming on, the Army withdrew from that place. This was because the desperate Distress which the Enemy was in was unknown to us, for the <hi>Indians</hi> have since said, that if the <hi>English</hi> had continued at the Swamp all night, nay, if they had but followed them but one half hour longer, <hi>Philip</hi> had come and yielded up himself. But God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>aw that we were not yet fit for Deliverance, nor could Health be restored unto us except a great deal more Blood be first taken from us: and other places as well as <hi>Plimouth</hi> stood in need of such a Course to be taken with them. It might rationally be conjectured, that the unsuccessfulness of this Expedition against <hi>Philip</hi> would embolden the <hi>Heathen</hi> in other parts to do as he had done, and so it came to pass. For <hi>July</hi> 14. the <hi>Nipnep</hi> (or <hi>Nipmuck) Indians</hi> began their mischief at a Town called <hi>Mendam</hi> (had we amended our ways as we should have done, this Misery might have been prevented) where they committed <hi>Barbarous Murders.</hi> This day deserves to have a <hi>Remark</hi> set upon it, considering that Blood was never shed in <hi>Massachusets Colony</hi> in a way of Hostility before this day. Moreover the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God herein is the more awful and tremendous, in that this very day the Church in <hi>Dorchester</hi> was before the Lord, humbling themselves by Fasting and Prayer, on account of <hi>the Day of trouble</hi> now begun amongst us.</p>
               <p>The news of this Blood-shed came to us at <hi>Boston</hi> the next day in Lecture time, in the midst of the Sermon, the Scripture then improved being that <hi>Isai. 42. 24. Who gave Jacob to the spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the Lord, he against whom we have sinned?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As yet <hi>Philip</hi> kept in the Swamp at <hi>Pocasset,</hi> but <hi>August</hi> 1. (being the Lords day) he fled. The <hi>English</hi> hearing that <hi>Philip</hi> was upon flight pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued him with a party of <hi>Monhegins,</hi> i. e, <hi>Æ²nkas</hi> (who approved himself faithful to the <hi>English</hi> almost forty years ago in the time of the <hi>Peguod</hi> Wars, and now also in this present War) his <hi>Indians,</hi> They overtook <hi>Philips</hi> Party and killed about thirty of his men, none of ours being at that time cut off. Had the <hi>English</hi> pursued the Enemy they might easily have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Women and Children that were with <hi>Philip,</hi> yea and himself also, and so have put an end to these tumults: but though Deliverance was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all Humane probability near, God saw it not good for us as yet. Wherefore <hi>Philip</hi> escaped and went to the <hi>Nipmuck Indians,</hi> who had newly (as hath been intimated) done Acts of Hostility against the <hi>English.</hi> In the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40970:8"/> mean while endeavours were used to keep those <hi>Indians</hi> from engaging in this War, and that those persons who had committed the Murder at <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> might be delivered up to Justice. Captain <hi>Hutchinson</hi> with a small par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was sent to <hi>Quabaog,</hi> where there was a great Rendezvouze of <hi>Nipnep Indians.</hi> They appointed time and place of Treaty to be attended, <hi>August</hi> 2. Accordingly Captain <hi>Hutchinson</hi> rode to the Place fixed on to Treat in. But the <hi>Indians</hi> came not thither according to their Agreement, whereupon Captain <hi>Hutchinson</hi> resolved to go further to seek after them elsewhere, and as he was riding along, the Perfidious <hi>Indians</hi> lying in Ambuscado in a Swamp, shot at him and wounded him, of which Wounds he after dyed, and eight men that were with him were struck down dead upon the place. Captain <hi>Wheeler</hi> who was in that Company was shot through the Arm, his dutiful Son alighting to relieve his Father, was himself shot and sorely wounded, willingly hazarding his own life to save the life of his Father. The <hi>English</hi> were not in a capacity to look after their dead, but those dead bodies were left as meat for the Fowls of Heaven, and their Flesh unto the Beasts of the Earth, and there was none to bury them.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Hutchinson</hi> and the rest that escaped with their lives, hastened to <hi>Quabaog,</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> speedily followed, violently set upon the Town, killed divers, burning all the Houses therein down to the ground, except only one unto which the Inhabitants fled for succour, and now also (as since we have understood) did <hi>Philip</hi> with his broken Party come to <hi>Quabaog.</hi> Hundreds of <hi>Indians</hi> beset the House, and took possession of a Barn belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, from whence they often shot into the House, and also at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to fire it six times, but could not prevail, at last they took a Cart full of Flax and other combustible matter, and brought it near the House, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to set it on fire; and then there was no appearing possibility, but all the <hi>English</hi> there, Men and Women, and Children must have perished, either by unmerciful flames, or more unmerciful hands of wicked Men, whose tender Mercies are cruelties, so that all hope that they should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved was then taken away: but behold in this Mount of Difficulty and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>the Lord is seen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in the very nick of opportunity God sent that worthy Major <hi>Willard,</hi> who with forty and eight men set upon the <hi>Indians</hi> and caused them to turn their backs, so that poor People who were given up for dead, had their lives given them for a prey. Surely this was a token for good, that however we may be diminished and brought low through Oppression, Affliction, and Sorrow, yet our God will have compassion on us, and this his People shall not utterly perish. And this Salvation is the more remarkable, for that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the <hi>Indians</hi> had ordered Scouts to ly in the way, and to give notice by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40970:8"/> firing three Guns, if any <hi>English</hi> came to the relief of the Distressed; yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Scouts fired when Major <hi>Willard</hi> and his Souldiers were past them, the <hi>Indians</hi> were so busie and made such a noise about the House that they heard not the report of those Guns; which if they had heard, in all probability not only the People then living at <hi>Quabaog,</hi> but those also that came to succour them had been cut off.</p>
               <p>Things being brought to this state, the Tumult of those that are risen up increaseth continually: For <hi>August</hi> 22. being the Lords Day, the <hi>Indians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Lancaster</hi> killed a Man and his Wife and two Children in the afternoon Exercise. And we hear that <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Quaboag Indians</hi> are gone more Westward, not far from <hi>North-hampton, Hadly, Deer-field,</hi> &amp;c. Whereupon Forces are sent from hence under the command of Captain <hi>Lothrop,</hi> Captain <hi>Beers,</hi> and after that Captain <hi>Mosely,</hi> to relieve those distressed Towns, and pursue the enemy. Also our Brethren at <hi>Connecticut</hi> afforded their Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Major <hi>Treat</hi> being sent to <hi>Hadly</hi> with a party of <hi>English,</hi> and some of <hi>Æ²nkas</hi> his Men. The <hi>Indians</hi> inhabiting about <hi>Connecticut River</hi> pretended great fidelity to the <hi>English,</hi> and that they would fight against <hi>Philip,</hi> who it seems had been tampering with them in the Spring before the War broke out, endeavouring by money (<hi>i. e. Wampampeag</hi> which is the <hi>Indians</hi> Money) to engage them in his bloody design against the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At first they were so far credited as to be Armed by the <hi>English,</hi> hoping they might do good service as the <hi>Monhegins</hi> and <hi>Natick Indians</hi> had done. But within a while their Treachery was justly suspected. Whereupon Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were sent (on or about <hi>August</hi> 25.) to demand their Arms. They were then gone out of their Forts, our Men searching after them, they sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly shot out of a Swamp, and after that an hot dispute continued for some hours. How many <hi>Indians</hi> were slain we know not, but nine <hi>English</hi> fell that day: wherein this Providence is observable, that those <hi>nine men</hi> which were killed at that time belonged to <hi>nine several Towns;</hi> as if the Lord should say, that he hath a controversie with every Plantation, and therefore all had need to repent and reform their ways.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>English</hi> have a multitude of open enemies more than when this trouble began, so that greater desolations are now expected.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>September</hi> 1. the <hi>Indians</hi> set upon <hi>Deerfield</hi> (alias <hi>Pacomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuck</hi>) and killed one man, and laid most of the Houses in that new hopeful Plantation in ruinous heaps. That which addeth solemnity and awfulness to that Desolation, is, that it happened on the very day when one of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>Boston</hi> were seeking the face of God by Fasting and Prayer before him. Also that very day the Church in <hi>Hadly</hi> was before the Lord in the same way, but were driven from the Holy Service they were attending
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40970:9"/> by a most sudden and violent <hi>Alarm,</hi> which routed them the whole day after. So that we may humbly complain, as sometimes the Church did, <hi>how long hast thou smoaked <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>ur War with the <hi>Indians:</hi> I shall in answer to your desire relate the most remarkable passages: The people here having many causes of jealousie, of the unfaithfulness of our <hi>Indians</hi> presented the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Committees of the Militia, whereupon it was thought meet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of them the surrendry of their Arms, and by perswasion obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine and twenty: But about three days after they being desirous to go forth with some Forces from <hi>Harford,</hi> both <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> and some from the <hi>Bay</hi> in pursuit of <hi>Philip,</hi> their Arms were delivered to them again: but a while after their returnâ–ª jealousies still increasing, there was a general desire in the People of these three Towns, that they should be again disarmed, and such things as these were presented to the Council here, as inducing thereunto: 1. That when they heard of the Massacre at <hi>Quabaog,</hi> they made in the Fort eleven Acclamations of joy, according to the number of our men that were slain. 2. A <hi>Frenchman</hi> that was going to <hi>Boston</hi> gave Testimony that he met three <hi>Indians</hi> that told him they were coming to perswade <hi>North-Hampton Indians</hi> to fight with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> and that at his return he askt our <hi>Indians</hi> whether they would fight, they said they could not tell. 3. One of their <hi>Sachims</hi> owned that there were several among them false to the <hi>English,</hi> but would not tell who thy were. 4. A Woman of ours was warned by a <hi>Squaw</hi> to remove with her Children into the middle of the Town: told her withal, she durst not tell News, for if she did the <hi>Indians</hi> would cut off her head. 5. Some of theirs gave out very suspicious Expressions; one upbraided the <hi>English,</hi> that <hi>Coy</hi> was dead already, and <hi>Eyer</hi> and <hi>Pritchet</hi> were dead already; said further that the <hi>Indians</hi> went out to find <hi>Philip</hi> with the <hi>English,</hi> that when <hi>Philip</hi> was fighting with them in the front, they might fall on them in the rear: another said the reason why he went not out with the Army was that he might help to destroy the <hi>English</hi> at home: another threatned
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40970:9"/> a Maid of our Town to knock her on the head. 6. When they were out with our Army, they shewed much unwillingness to fight, alledging they must not fight against their Mothers and Brothers and Cousins (for <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baog Indians</hi> are related unto them.) 7. <hi>Æ²nkas</hi> his son, who went out the same time, complained that our <hi>Indians</hi> had almost spoiled his, and that the <hi>English</hi> were blind and could not see the falshood of these <hi>Indians.</hi> 8. They shot bullets five several times at our men in diverse places. Other things too many to numerate were presented, and the Council saw cause to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Arms, <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. They made some Objections, but were fully answered: The Sachem left the Council to try whether he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the <hi>Indians,</hi> promising however to bring in his own. In the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon the Council sent to the Fort for their answer: they told the Messenger that some <hi>Indians</hi> were abroad in the Meadows, and they were not willing to deliver up their Arms without their consent: but in the morning they should have their answer. The Messenger was desired to go again to them in the evening, to confer with them, to try whether he could perswade them, and coming to the other side of the River, wisht some of them to come over: they bid him come over to them, and bid him kissâ€”Whereupon Captain <hi>Lothrop</hi> and <hi>Beers,</hi> with whom the thing was left, intended to take their Arms by force, and at midnight sent over to our officers, to draw as night the Fort as they could without being perceived, and they would do the like on <hi>Hatfield</hi> side, and so at break of day come upon them: but before they came the <hi>Indians</hi> were fled, having killed an old <hi>Sachem</hi> that was not willing to go with them. The Captains resolved to follow them, and pursued a great pace after them, with about an hundred men, having sent back a part of ours for a Guard of the Town. A little before they overtook the <hi>Indians,</hi> they heard two strange claps of Thunder, like two volleys of shot; at length they saw a single <hi>Indian,</hi> but shot not at him, though they might have killed him, because they intended to parly with them: but on a sudden the <hi>Indians</hi> let fly about forty Guns at them, and was soon answered by a volley from our men; about forty ran down into the Swamp after them, poured in shot upon them, made them throw down much of their luggage, and after a while our Men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Indian</hi> manner got behind trees, and watcht their opportunities to make shots at them; the Fight continued about three hours, we lost six men upon the ground, though one was shot in the back by our own men, a seventh died of his wound coming home, and two died the next night, nine in all, of nine several Towns, every one of these Towns lost a man: Of the <hi>Indians</hi> as we hear since by a <hi>Squaw</hi> that was taken, and by three Children that came to our Town from them the day after, there were slain
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40970:10"/> twenty six: the same day there was an <hi>Indian</hi> that lodged in our Town the night before, taken by our men, and a <hi>Squaw</hi> that belonged to our Fort that was coming from <hi>Spring-field;</hi> they both own that our <hi>Indians</hi> received <hi>Wompam</hi> from <hi>Philip</hi> in the Spring, to ingage them in the War. The fellow also owns that there were seven of our <hi>Indians</hi> that went to <hi>Quabaog,</hi> where they heard that they intended to fight. After this fight we heard no more of them till the first of <hi>September,</hi> when they shot down a Garrison Souldier of <hi>Pacomptuck</hi> that was looking after his horse, and ran violently up into the Town, many people having scarcely time enough to get into the Garrisons. That day they burnt most of their houses and barns, the Garrisons not being strong enough to sally out upon them, but killed two of their men from the Forts. The next day they set upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral men that were gone out of the Fort at <hi>Squakheag,</hi> they slew eight of our men, not above one of them being slain that we know of, but made no attempt upon the Fort. The next day (this Onset being unknown) Capt. <hi>Beers</hi> set forth with about thirty six men and some Carts to fetch off the Garrison at <hi>Squakheag,</hi>

                           </note> and coming within three miles of the Place, the next morning were set upon by a great number of <hi>Indians</hi> from the side of a Swamp, where was an hot Dispute for some time: They having lost their <hi>Captain</hi> and some others, resolved at last to fly, and going to take horse lost several men more, I think about twelve: the most that escaped got to <hi>Hadly</hi> that evening: next morning another came in, and at night another that had been taken by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and loosed from his bonds by a <hi>Natick Indian,</hi> he tells the <hi>Indians</hi> were all drunk that night, that they mourned much for the loss of a great Captain, that the <hi>English</hi> had killed twenty five of their men. Six days after another Souldier came in, who had been lost ever since the fight, and was almost famished, and so lost his understanding that he knew not what day the fight was on.</p>
                        <p>On the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> Major <hi>Treat</hi> set forth for <hi>Squakheag</hi> with above an hundred men, next day coming nigh <hi>Squakheag,</hi> his men were much daunted to see the heads of Captain <hi>Beers</hi>'s Souldiers upon Poles by the way side; but after they were come to <hi>Squakheag,</hi> some partyes of them went into the Meadow, but hearing some Guns about the Fort, they ran up to see what the matter was, but by the way were fired upon by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fourteen <hi>Indians</hi> as they judge out of the Bushes: one or two <hi>Indians</hi> were slain; Major <hi>Treat</hi> was struck upon the thigh, the bullet pierced his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40970:10"/> cloaths, but had lost its force, and did him no harm: coming to the Fort, he called his Council together, and concluded forthwith to bring off the Garrison: so they came away the same night, leaving the Cattel there, and the dead bodies unburied: since which, seventeen of their Cattel came a great part of the way themselves, and have since been fetcht into <hi>Hadly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon the <hi>12th</hi> of this month the <hi>Indians</hi> made an assault upon twenty two men of <hi>Pocomptuck,</hi> that were going from one Garrison to the other to <hi>Meeting</hi> in the afternoon; made a great volley of shot at them, but killed not one man, they escaped to the Garrison whether they were going, only one man running to the other Garrison was taken alive: The <hi>Indians</hi> took up their Rendezvouze on an hill in the meadow burnt two more hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, killed many horses, carried away horse-loads of beef and pork to the hill: they sent the same night for more aid, but partly through the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Commission of our Garrison Souldiers, or at least their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, and partly through the wetness of the weather, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done that night: the next day we perswaded some of our Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to go Volunteers, and sent to <hi>Hadly</hi> to do the like, who going up with some of Captain <hi>Louthrops</hi> souldiers, joyned themselves to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison at <hi>Pocomptuck,</hi> and on Tuesday very early went out to assault the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> but they were all fled. Last night Captain <hi>Mosely</hi> with his men came into <hi>Hadly,</hi> and this night we expect more Forces from <hi>Hartford.</hi>

                     <p>I desire you would speak to the <hi>Governour,</hi> that there may be some thorough Care for a <hi>Reformation,</hi> I am sensible there are many difficulties therein: many sins are grown so in fashion, that it becomes a question whether they be sins or no.

Let me hear soon from you: the Lord bless you and your Labours; forget us not at the Throne of Grace. It would be a dreadful Token of the Displeasure of God, if these afflictions pass away without much spiritual advantage.

               <p>Not many days after this Letter was written, the <hi>English</hi> received a sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der rebuke of Providence, than any thing that hitherto had been. For <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 18. Captain <hi>Lothrop</hi> (a godly and couragious Commander) with above seventy men were sent to be as a Guard to some that were coming from <hi>Deerfield</hi> with Carts loaden with Goods and Provision, to be removed to <hi>Hadlyâ–ª</hi> for security: But as they were coming, the <hi>Indians,</hi> whose cruel Habitations are the dark corners of the Earth, lurked in the Swamps, and multitudes of them made a sudden and frigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ful assault. They seized upon the Carts and Goods (many of the Souldiers having been so foolish and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, as to put their Arms in the Carts, and step aside to gather Grapes, which proved dear and deadly Grapes to them) killed Captain <hi>Lothrop,</hi> and above threescore of his men, stripped them of their Cloths, and so left them to lye weltring in their own Blood. Captain <hi>Mosely</hi> who was gone out to range the Woods, hearing the Guns, hastened to their help, but before he could come, the other Captain and his men were slain, as hath been expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Nevertheless he gave the <hi>Indians</hi> Battle, they were in such numbers, as that he and his company were in extreme danger, the <hi>Indians</hi> indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (according to their mode of fighting) to encompass the <hi>English</hi> round, and then to press in upon them with great numbers, so to knock them down with their Hatchets. In the nick of time Major <hi>Treat,</hi> with above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, and threescore of <hi>Æ²nkas</hi> his <hi>Indians</hi> came in to succour those that were so beset with the Enemy, whereupon the Enemy presently retreated, and night coming on, there was no pursuing of them. In this fight but few of Captain <hi>Mosely</hi>'s men were slain. How many <hi>Indians</hi> were killed is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, it being their manner to draw away their dead men, as fast as they are killed, if possibly they can do it; yea they will venture their own lives for that end, which they do out of policy, that so their enemies may think, that few or none of them are killed, when nevertheless they have lost many. I am informed that some of the <hi>Indians</hi> have reported that they lost ninety six men that day, and that they had above forty wounded, many of which dyed afterwards. However, this was a black and fatal day, wherein there were eight persons made Widows, and six and twenty Children made Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less: all in one little Plantation, and in one day; and above sixty Persons buried in one dreadful Grave. And this was the state of the <hi>Western</hi> parts in respect of the War with the Heathen.</p>
               <p>We must now take a step backwards, and a little consider the <hi>Eastern Plantations.</hi> For in the Month of <hi>September</hi> did the flame break out there. Some who had their hearts exercised in discerning things of that nature, were from the beginning of the War, not without sad apprehensions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Inhabitants in those parts of the Country, in that they were a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40970:11"/> scattered People, and such as had many of them scandalized the Heathen, and lived themselves too like unto the Heathen, without any <hi>Instituted Ordinances,</hi> also the <hi>Indians</hi> thereabouts were more numerous than in some other places. They began their outrages, at the House of one Mr. <hi>Purchase,</hi> who had been a great Trader with the <hi>Indians.</hi> After that they came to the House of an old Man in <hi>Casco-Bayâ–ª</hi> whose name was <hi>Wakely.</hi> Him with his Wife, Son, and Daughter in law (who was great with Child) and two Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children, they cruelly Murdered, and took three Children alive, and led them into Captivity.</p>
               <p>This old <hi>Wakely</hi> was esteemed a godly Man. He would somet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

But the God which appeared to him, said nothing to him about Jesus Christ; and therefore it is not to be marvelled at, that at last he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himself to be no otherwise than a Child of him, that was a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer and a Lyar from the beginning. Also these inraged <hi>Barbarians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing animated with their success at <hi>Falmouth</hi> and <hi>Sacoe,</hi> they went to <hi>Black-Point.</hi> and there killed six Men and a Woman, and burnt two and twenty dwelling Houses.

The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent endeavours of the <hi>English</hi> proved happily successful, insomuch as the <hi>Sachems</hi> there, brought Presents with great Protestations of Amity and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and desired that no more Liquors might be so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40970:12"/> and that they were not able to keep their Men in subjection, when once they were become mad with Drink.</p>
               <p>After these things, the <hi>Indians</hi> killed two men at <hi>Kittery,</hi> and stripped them. Lieutenant <hi>Playster,</hi> with twenty two <hi>English,</hi> went out to fetch off the dead Bodies, and to bury them; as they were putting one of them into the Cart, suddenly a small party of <hi>Indians</hi> shot out of a Swamp. And the greatest part of the <hi>English</hi> did unworthily forsake their <hi>Leader</hi> in that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, only seven remained with him. He thinking his Men had been near at hand, faced the Enemy, killed and wounded many of them; but the <hi>Indians</hi> perceiving that all but seven of the <hi>English</hi> were fled, took courage and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Mr. <hi>Playster</hi> (who was a good and useful man) and one of his Sons, and another man: The other four seeing that, ran for their lives, and so escaped until they came safe into a <hi>Garrison,</hi> which was not far off.</p>

                  <hi>October</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> This day of Humiliation appointed by the Council, was solemnly observed: Yet attended with awful testimonies of Divine displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The very next day after this Fast was agreed upon by those in Civil Authority, was that dismal and fatal blow, when Captain <hi>Lothorp</hi> and his Company (in all near upon fourscore souls) were slaughtered, whereby the Heathen were wonderfully animated, some of them triumphing and saying, That so great slaughter was never known: And indeed in their Wars, one with another, the like hath rarely been heard of. And that very day when this Fast was kept, three Persons were killed by the <hi>Indians</hi> near <hi>Dover,</hi> one of them going from the publick Worship. Also that very day at the close of it, the sad tidings of <hi>Springfields</hi> Calamity came to us here in <hi>Boston.</hi> And
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40970:13"/> inasmuch as this news came at the conclusion of a day of Humiliation, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>the solemn voice of God to New-England</hi> is still as formerly, <hi>Praying</hi> without <hi>Reforming</hi> will not do. And now is the day come wherein the Lord is fulnl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the word which himself hath spoken, saying, I will send wild Beasts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, which shall rob you of your Children, and destroy your Cattle, and make you few in number, <hi>and if you will not be reform'd by these things, I will bring your Sanctuaries to Desolation, and I will not smell the sweet Savor of your Odours.</hi> The Providence of God is never to be forgotten, in that <hi>Churches have been signally spared for so long a time.</hi> Although some Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherein Churches have been settled were in most eminent danger, and the Enemy might easily have swallowed them up, yet God so ordered that they received little or no detriment, when other places were laid utterly waste, the Lord manifesting how loth he was to disgrace the Throne of his Glory, but now he begins with the Sanctuary. As for <hi>Springfields</hi> misery, it thus came to pass: Whereas there was a body of <hi>Indians</hi> that lived in a <hi>Fort</hi> near to that <hi>Town</hi> of <hi>Springfield,</hi> and professed nothing but Friendship towards the <hi>English;</hi> they treacherously brake in upon the Town, when a party of our Souldiers who had been there, were newly gone to <hi>Hadly.</hi> They killed several, amongst others their Lieutenant <hi>Cooper</hi> was most persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously Murthered by them, without the least occasion or Provocation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They burnt down to the ground above thirty dwelling-houses; and above twenty out-houses: amongst others, Mr. <hi>Pelatiah Glover,</hi> Teacher of the Church there, is a great sufferer, his House, and Goods, and Books, and Writings being all consumed in one hour. Nevertheless there was a great mixture of mercy in this dark and dismal dispensation. For God so ordered, as that an <hi>Indian</hi> who knew what was designed the next day, ran away in the night, and acquainted the <hi>English</hi> therewith, whence they had time and opportunity to escape to an house that was Fortified; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in probability the Inhabitants had surely had their lives as well as their dwelling places cut off.</p>

                  <hi>October</hi> 13. The <hi>General Court</hi> sat in <hi>Boston,</hi> during this Session, a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> was with the concurrence of both Houses appointed in order to a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> of those Evils which have provoked the Lord to bring the Sword upon us, and to withdraw from our <hi>Armies</hi> from time to time. The Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Teaching Elders</hi> in the Churches was desired, as in a case of that nature, it was proper for them to advise and help according to God.</p>
               <p>There was a gracious presence of God with them in their consultations, all that were there with one voice agreeing in many particulars, in respect whereof <hi>Reformation</hi> should be, and must be: <hi>e. g.</hi>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">That some effectual course should be taken for the Suppression of those proud Excesses in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40970:14"/> hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which many (yea and the poorer sort as well as others) are shamefully guilty of. That a due testimony should be born against such as are false Worshippers, especially Idolatrous <hi>Quakers,</hi> who set up Altars against the Lords Altar, yea who set up a Christ whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures know not. That whereas excess in drinking is become a common Sin, means should be used to prevent an unnecessary multiplication of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, and to keep Town dwellers from frequenting Taverns: and that whereas Swearing hath been frequently heard, they that hear another Swear profanely and do not complain of it to Authority, shall be punished for that concealment. Also that some further care should be taken, that the fourth and fifth Commandments be better observed than formerly; and that there may be no more such Oppression, either by Merchants or day-Labourers as heretofore hath been; and that the <hi>Indian</hi> Trading-houses, whereby the Heathen have been debauched and scandalized against Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be suppressed; and that more care should be taken respecting the <hi>Rising Generation,</hi> than formerly hath been, that they might be brought under the discipline of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These things were unanimously consented to.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> 19. The Conclusions of the Committee, respecting <hi>Reformation</hi> of provoking evils were signed, and delivered into the General Court, who voted acceptance thereof, and appointed another Committee to draw up Laws in order to the establishment of the things agreed on. Now as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that famous Martyrologist Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> (in <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> vol. 2. pag. 669.) observes, with respect to the <hi>Reformation in</hi> K. <hi>Edward</hi> VI. his days, that that very day and hour when the Act for <hi>Reformation</hi> was put in execution at <hi>London,</hi> God gave the <hi>English</hi> a signal victory against the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Muscleborough;</hi> so it was proportionably with us. For that day when there was a vote passed for the Suppression and Reformation of those manifest evils, whereby the eyes of Gods Glory are provoked amongst us, the Lord gave success to our Forces, who that day encountred with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> at <hi>Hatfield.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> lost but one man in the fight (albeit some that were sent forth as Scouts were killed or Captivated) the Enemy fled before them, and ran into the River, many of them being seen to fall, but night coming on, it was in vain to follow them further. And after that day, the <hi>Western Plantations</hi> had little or no disturbance by them, but lived in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness all the Winter. All this notwithstanding, we may say as sometimes the Lords People of old, <hi>the Harvest is past, the Summer is ended, and we are not saved.</hi> The Sword having marched <hi>Eastward, and Westward, and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> now beginneth to face toward the <hi>South</hi> again. The <hi>Narragansets,</hi> who were the greatest body of <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi> there being no less then six Sachims amongst them; having not as yet appeared in open
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40970:14"/> Hostility. Nevertheless <hi>Philips and Squaw-Sackims</hi> men, when routed by the <hi>English</hi> Forces, were harboured amongst the <hi>Narragansets.</hi> When the Commissioners of the united Colonies sat at <hi>Boston,</hi> in the latter end of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> one of the <hi>Narraganset Sachims,</hi> and Messengers from other <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chims</hi> there, made their appearance in <hi>Boston;</hi> they pretended nothing but good-will to the <hi>English,</hi> and promised that those Enemies of ours, who had burnt so many houses, and committed so many Murders, and had fled to them for refuge, should be delivered up by the latter end of <hi>October.</hi> But when the time prefixed for the surrendry of the <hi>Wompanoags</hi> and <hi>Squaw-Sachems Indians</hi> was lapsed, they pretended they could not do as they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged at present, but after Winter they would do it. In the mean while, when the <hi>English</hi> had any ingagement with the <hi>Indians,</hi> wounded <hi>Indians</hi> came home to the <hi>Narragansets,</hi> especially after the fight at <hi>Hatfield, Octob.</hi> 19. about forty wounded men were seen crossing the woods towards the <hi>Narragansets:</hi> also some (at least two <hi>Indians</hi>) from amongst themselves, came to the <hi>English,</hi> and told them that the <hi>Narragansets</hi> were resolved (if they could) to destroy the <hi>English:</hi> but they were loth to begin to fall upon them before Winter, but in the Spring when they should have the leaves of trees and <hi>Swamps</hi> to befriend them, they would do it: wherefore it was judged necessary to send out Forces against them, and preparartions were made accordingly.</p>
               <p>There was some agitation amongst those whom it did concern, where a person suitable for so great a trust might be found as <hi>General;</hi> and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman <hi>Josiah Winslow</hi> Esq; who succeeds his Father (of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) as Governour of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> was pitched upon for this Shrvice.</p>
               <p>Under his conduct therefore, an Army consisting of at first a thousand, and at last about fifteen hundred men, were sent forth to execute the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Lord upon the perfidious and bloudy Heathen. But before they set out, the Churches were all upon their knees before the Lord, the God of Armies, intreating his favour and gracious success in that undertaking, wherein the welfare of his people was so greatly concerned. This day of Prayer and Humiliation was observed <hi>Decemb.</hi> 2. when also something hapned intimating as if the Lord were still angry with our Prayers; for this day all the houses in <hi>Quonsickamuck</hi> were burnt by the <hi>Indians.</hi>

                  <hi>Decemb.</hi> 8. The Army set out from <hi>Boston.</hi> Whilst they were upon this march, an <hi>Indian</hi> whose name was <hi>Peter,</hi> having received some disgust among his Country-men, came to the <hi>English,</hi> and discovered the plots of the <hi>Indians,</hi> told where they were, and promised to conduct the Army to them. They were no sooner arrived in the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Country, but they killed and took captive above forty <hi>Indians.</hi> Being come to Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:40970:15"/> house, they waited some days for <hi>Connecticut</hi> Forces. In the mean while a party of the enemy did treacherously get into the house of <hi>Jerem. Bull</hi> (where was a Garison) burned the house, and slew about fourteen persons.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>
                  <hi>Decemb. 18. Connecticut</hi> Forces being come, a March toward the enemy was resolved upon: <hi>Peter Indian</hi> having informed that the Body of <hi>Indians</hi> (only <hi>Ninnigret</hi> being one of their old crafty <hi>Sachems,</hi> had with some of his men withdrawn himself from the rest, professing that he would not ingage in a War with the <hi>English,</hi> therefore did he go into a place more remote) was in a Fort about eighteen miles distant from the place where our Army now was. The next day, although it were the Sabbath, yet, provisions being almost spent our Souldiers, waiting so long for <hi>Connecticut</hi> Forces, the Council of War resolved to give Battle to the enemy. The <hi>English</hi> Souldiers played the men wonderfully; the <hi>Indians</hi> also fought stoutly, but were at last beat out of their Fort, which was taken by the <hi>English,</hi> There were hundreds of <hi>Wigwams</hi> (or <hi>Indian</hi> houses) within the Fort, which our Souldiers set on fire, in the which men, women and children (no man knoweth how many hundreds of them) were burnt to death. Night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, a Retreat was sounded.</p>
               <p>Concerning the number of <hi>Indians</hi> slain in this Battle, we are uncertain: only some <hi>Indians</hi> which afterwards were taken prisoners (as also a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>English</hi> man that apostatized to the Heathen, and fought with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his own Country-men but was at last taken and executed) confessed that the next day they found three hundred of their fighting men dead in their Fort, and that many men, women and children were burned in their <hi>Wigwams,</hi> but they neither knew, nor could conjecture how many: it is supposed that not less than a thousand <hi>Indian</hi> Souls perished at that time. <hi>Ninnigret</hi> whose men buried the slain, affirmeth that they found twenty and two <hi>Indian</hi> Captains among the dead bodies. Of the <hi>English</hi> there were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and wounded about two hundred and thirty, whereof only eighty and five persons are dead. But there was a solemn rebuke of Providence at this time, in that six of our Captains were slain, <hi>viz.</hi> Captain <hi>Johnson</hi> of <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> Captain <hi>Gardner</hi> of <hi>Salem,</hi> Captain <hi>Davenport</hi> of <hi>Boston</hi> (son to that Captain <hi>Davenport</hi> who did great Service in the expedition against the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> in the <hi>Pequod</hi> War, <hi>Anno</hi> 1637.) Captain <hi>Gallop</hi> of <hi>New-London,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Marshal</hi> of <hi>Windsor,</hi> Captain <hi>Seily</hi> of <hi>Stratford,</hi> who dyed of his wounds some days after the fight was over. The three Captains first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, belonged to <hi>Mattachusets</hi> Colony, the three last to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> of <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony Captain <hi>Bradford</hi> (one of their faithful Magistrates, and son of him that was many years Governor there) was sorely wounded, but God had mercy on him, and on his people in him, so as to spare his life, and to restore him to some measure of health, albeit the bullet shot into him is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40970:15"/> still in his body. Also Captain <hi>Goram</hi> of <hi>Barnstaple</hi> in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony fell sick of a fever whereof he died.</p>
               <p>Thus did the Lord take away seven Captains out of that Army. Also four <hi>Lieutenants</hi> were wounded in that <hi>Fort-fight,</hi> so that though the <hi>English</hi> had the better of it, yet not without solemn and humbling rebukes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. At night as the Army returned to their quarters a great Snow fell, also part of the Army mist their way, among whom was the General him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with his Life-guard. Had the Enemy known their advantage, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued our Soldiers (and we have since heard that some of the <hi>Indians</hi> did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly move that it might be so, but others of them through the over-ruling hand of Providence would not consent) when upon their retreat, they might easily have cut off the whole Army: But God would be more gracious to us. Here then was not only a Victory, but also a signal Preservation, for which let the Father of mercies have eternal glory.</p>
               <p>After this God seemed to withdraw from the <hi>English</hi> and take part with the Enemy. The next day the <hi>Indians</hi> finding but few <hi>English</hi> men dead in the Fort among their three hundred <hi>Indians</hi> that were slain, were much troubled and amazed, supposing that no more of ours had been killed; this blow did greatly astonish them, and had the <hi>English</hi> immediately pursued the Victory begun, in all likelihood there had been an end of our troubles; but God saw that neither yet were we fit for deliverance. Wherefore <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> forces withdrew to <hi>Stonington,</hi> and there being so many killed and wounded amongst those that remained in the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Country, also bread for the Soldiers being wanting, by reason the extremity of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was such, as that the Vessels laden with Provision could not reach them, therefore the Army lay still some weeks.</p>
               <p>In this interval of time the Town of <hi>Mendam</hi> (which before that had been forsaken of its Inhabitants) was burnt down by the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now doth the Lord Jesus begin solemnly to fulfil his word, in <hi>removing Candlesticks</hi> out of their places, because of <hi>contentions</hi> and loss loss of <hi>first love.</hi> Surely when those places are destroyed where Churches have been planted, Candlesticks are removed out of their places. But to proceed, when the Army was just upon the resolve to return home, because Provisions were spent, God so ordered, as that a Vessel laden with Victuals arrived, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was determined (g=f) to pursue the Enemy. Only it was thought necessary to desist from this pursuit until <hi>Connecticut</hi> forces could return and join with ours. In the <hi>interim,</hi> a strange sudden Thaw happened in the midst of <hi>January</hi> (when in <hi>New-England</hi> the season is wont to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme cold) that the snow melted away in a little time: the like weather hath rarely been known in this Land at that time of the year, albeit some of the first Planters say it was so above fifty years ago. However this made
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40970:16"/> wonderfully for the <hi>Indians</hi> advantage, for now they fled out of the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganset</hi> Country, and whereas they had been sorely straightned and distressed for victuals, now the snow being wasted, they lived upon Ground-nuts.</p>
               <p>In fine, the Army pursued them several days, overtook some of them, killed and took about seventy persons, were in sight of the main Body of them, and could they have held out to have pursued them but one day longer probably this unhappy War had then been ended: but the Souldiers were tired with eight days March, and (having spent much of their provision whilst waiting for our <hi>Connecticut</hi> Brethren) their bread failed, so as that they were forced to kill horses and feed upon them.</p>
               <p>We have often carried it before the Lord as if we would <hi>Reform</hi> our ways, and yet when it hath come to, we have done nothing: So hath the Lord carried toward us, as if he would deliver us, and yet hath deferred our <hi>Salvation,</hi> as we our selves have delayed <hi>Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then <hi>February</hi> 5. The Army returned to <hi>Boston,</hi> not having obtained the end of their going forth. It was easie to conjecture that the <hi>Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi> and <hi>River Indians,</hi> being all come together, and the Army returned, they would speedily fall upon the <hi>Frontier Towns.</hi> And some of the Praying <hi>Indians</hi> who had been sent out as Spies, and had been with the <hi>Indians</hi> beyond <hi>Quabaog,</hi> brought intelligence, that a <hi>French Man</hi> that came from <hi>Canady</hi> had been amongst them, animating them against the <hi>English,</hi> promising a supply of <hi>Ammunition,</hi> and that they would come next Summer and assist them; also the <hi>Indian</hi> Spies declared, that there was a design, within such a time to burn <hi>Lancaster,</hi> which came to pass both as to the time and manner accordingly.</p>
               <p>For upon the 10. day of <hi>February</hi> some hundreds of the <hi>Indians</hi> fell upon <hi>Lancaster,</hi> burnt many of the Houses, kill'd and took Captive above forty persons. Mr. <hi>Rowlandson</hi> (the faithful Pastor of the Church there) had his House, Goods, Books, all burned; his Wife, and all his Children led away Captive before the Enemy. Himself (as God would have it) was not at home, whence his own person was delivered, which otherwise (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Miracle) would have been endangered. Eight men lost their lives, and were stripped naked by the <hi>Indians,</hi> because they ventured their lives to save Mrs. <hi>Rowlandson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As this good Man returned home (having been at <hi>Boston</hi> to intercede with the Council that something might be done for the safety of that place) he saw his <hi>Lancaster</hi> in flames, and his own house burnt down, not having heard of it till his eyes beheld it, and knew not what was become of the Wife of his bosom, and Children of his Bowels. This was a most awful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and hath made me often think on those words, <hi>though Noah, Job and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40970:16"/> Daniel were in it, they should deliver but their own souls, they should deliver nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sons nor daughters, they only shall be delivered, but the Land shall be deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> And this desolation is the more tremendous, in that this very day the Churches Westward were humbling themselves before the Lord. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few days after this, certain <hi>Indians</hi> did some mischiefs at <hi>Malbury, Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Chelmsford.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>
                  <hi>February</hi> 21. The <hi>Indians</hi> assaulted <hi>Medfield,</hi> and although there were two or three hundred Soldiers there, they burnt half the Town, killed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Men, Women and Children (about eighteen in all) amongst others their Lieutenant <hi>Adams</hi> was slain. And soon after he was killed, his Wife was casually slain by an English-man, whose Gun discharged before he was aware, and the Bullet therein passed through the Boards over-head, and mortally wounded Lieutenant <hi>Adams</hi>'s Wife. It is a sign God is angry, when he turns our weapons against our selves.</p>

                  <hi>February</hi> 23. A day of Humiliation was attended in the old Meeting-house in <hi>Boston,</hi> but not without much distraction, because of an Alarm, by reason of rumors, as if the <hi>Indians</hi> were doing mischief within ten miles of <hi>Boston.</hi>

               <p>In the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> another small Army was sent out from <hi>Boston,</hi> under the conduct of that expert Soldier and Commander Major <hi>Savage,</hi> to seek out the Enemy. <hi>Connecticut</hi> Forces met with ours at <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

The Leader of these <hi>Indians</hi> was one <hi>Totoson,</hi> a fellow who was well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that house, and had received many many kindnesses there, it being the manner of those brutish men, who are only skilful to destroy, to deal worst with those who have done most for them.</p>

               <p>When they had done that, they scoffed and blasphemed, and came to Mr. <hi>Willard</hi> (the worthy Pastor of the Church there) his house (which being fortified, they attempted not to destroy it) and tauntingly said, <hi>What will ye do for a house to pray in, now we have burnt your Meeting-House?</hi> Thus hath the Enemy done wickedly in the Sanctuary, they have burnt up the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of God in the Land; they have cast fire into the Sanctuary; they have cast down the dwelling place of his name to the ground. <hi>O God, how long shall the Adversary reproach? shall the Enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? why withdrawest thou thine hand, even thy right hand: pluck it out of thy bosom.</hi>

               <p>For <hi>March</hi> 26. 1676. being the Sabbath-day, the <hi>Indians</hi> assaulted <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and consumed a great part of the town; after which the Inhabitants apprehended themselves under a necessity of deserting that place, which was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40970:17"/> done accordingly; so that here is another Candlestick removed out of his place. This day also, Captain <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Scituate,</hi> with a party of about fifty <hi>English,</hi> and twenty <hi>Indians,</hi> who were Friends to the <hi>English,</hi> pursued a small number of the Enemy, who in desperate subtilty ran away from them, and they went limping to make the <hi>English</hi> believe they were lame, till they had led them into a snare: for suddenly a vast body of <hi>Indians</hi> did encompass them round; so that Captain <hi>Pierce</hi> was slain, and forty and nine <hi>English</hi> with him, and eight (or more) <hi>Indians</hi> who did assist the <hi>English,</hi> and fought bravely in that engagement.</p>
               <p>How many of the Enemy fell we know not certainly, only we hear that some <hi>Indians,</hi> which have since been taken by the <hi>English,</hi> confess that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Pierce,</hi> and those with him killed an hundred and forty of them before they lost their own lives.</p>
               <p>Upon this Lords-day another sad thing likewise hapned; for near <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> there were eighteen <hi>English</hi> men riding to the Town, to attend the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worship of God on his Holy-day, And although they were Armed, there were seven or eight <hi>Indians,</hi> who lying in Ambuscado, were so bold as to shoot at them. They killed a Man and a Maid that rode behind him, the <hi>English</hi> being surprised with fear, rode away to save their lives: in the mean while the <hi>Indians</hi> seized upon two women and children, and took them away alive, so that here we have cause to think of <hi>Joshuahs</hi> words, who said, <hi>O Lord, What shall I say when Israel turns their backs before the Enemies?</hi> What shall be said when eighteen <hi>English</hi> men well arm'd, fly before seven <hi>Indians?</hi> This seems to argue something of a divine forsaking, and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in Heaven against us. The next day those <hi>Indians</hi> were pursued, but when the <hi>English</hi> came in sight those barbarous wretches hasted to run away, but before they knocked the two Children on the head, as they were sucking their Mothers breasts, and then knocked their Mothers on the head: Nevertheless one of them was alive when the souldiers came to her, and able to give an account of what the <hi>Indians</hi> had told her. Amongst other particulars, they did affirm to her that there was a Body of about three thousand <hi>Indians</hi> (no doubt but in that they did hyperbolize) near to <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and that they had newly received a great supply of powder from the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Albany:</hi> men that worship <hi>Mammon,</hi> notwithstanding all prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the contrary, will expose their own and other mens lives unto dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if they may but gain a little of this worlds good.</p>

                  <hi>March</hi> 27.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40970:18"/> and that not altogether without success. For towards the morning whilst it was yet dark, they discerned where the <hi>Indians</hi> lay their Fires. And such was their boldness, as that about three hundred of them lay all night, within half a mile of one of the garison houses in that Town where they had done such mischief the day before. Albeit the darkness was such as an <hi>English</hi> man could not be discerned from an <hi>Indian,</hi> yet ours being forty in number, discharged several times upon the enemy, and (as <hi>Indians</hi> taken since that time do confess,) God so disposed of the bullets that were shot at that time, that no less than thirty <hi>Indians</hi> were wounded, of whom there were four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen that dyed, several of which had been principal actors in the late bloudy Tragedies.

               <p>The next day they burnt about thirty houses at the Town called <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>

               <p>In the beginning of <hi>April</hi> they did some mischief at <hi>Chelmsford</hi> and <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> where a small party of them put the Town into a great fright, caused all the people to fly into Garison-houses, killed one man, and burnt one house. And to shew what barbarous creatures they are, they exercised cruelty towards dumb creatures. They took a Cow, knocked off one of her horns cut out her tongue, and so left the poor creature in great misery. They put an Horse, Ox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into an hovil, and then set it on fire, only to shew how they are delighted in exercising cruelty.</p>

This week we hear from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> that a party of their Souldiers went with many of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quods,</hi> and <hi>Monhegins,</hi> and some of <hi>Ninnegrets Indians,</hi> to seek after the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and they killed and took captive forty and four <hi>Indians</hi> without the loss of any of ours: amongst whom were several of their Chief Captains, and their great Sachem called <hi>Quanonchet,</hi> who was a principal Ring-leader in the <hi>Narraganset</hi> War, and had as great an interest and influence, as can be said of any among the <hi>Indians.</hi> This great Sachem was pursued into a Rl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by one of <hi>Ninnegret</hi> his men, and there taken. Being apprehended he was carried away to <hi>Stonington,</hi> where the <hi>English</hi> caused the <hi>Pequods</hi> and <hi>Monhegins,</hi> and <hi>Ninnegrets Indians,</hi> to joyn together in shooting <hi>Quanon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehet,</hi> and cutting off his head, which was sent to <hi>Hartford.</hi> And herein the <hi>English</hi> dealt wisely, for by this means, those three <hi>Indian</hi> Nations are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40970:18"/> become abominable to the other <hi>Indians,</hi> and it is now their interest to be faithful to the <hi>English,</hi> since their own Country-men will never forgive them, on account of their taking and killing the Sachem mentioned: So that there was a gracious smile of providence in this thing, yet not without matter of humbling to us, in that the Sachem was apprehended not by <hi>English</hi> but by <hi>Indian</hi> hands.</p>

For the enemy set upon <hi>Sudbury,</hi> and burnt a great part of the Town, and whereas Captain <hi>Wadsworth</hi> (a prudent and faithful man) was sent out for their relief with about seventy armed men, a great body of <hi>Indians</hi> surrounded them, so as that above fifty of ours were slain that day, amongst whom was Captain <hi>Wadsworth</hi> and his Lieutenant <hi>Sharp.</hi> Also Captain <hi>Brattlebanck</hi> (a godly and choise spirited man) was killed at the same time. Also they took five or six of the <hi>English</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them away alive, but that night killed them in such a manner as none but <hi>Salvages</hi> would have done. For they stripped them naked, and caused them to run the Gauntlet, whipping them after a cruel and bloudy manner, and then threw hot ashes upon them; cut out the flesh of their legs, and put fire into their wounds, delighting to see the miserable torments of wretched creatures. Thus are they the perfect children of the Devil. What numbers the <hi>Indians</hi> lost in this fight, we know not, only a Captive since escaped out of their hands, affirms that the <hi>Indians</hi> said one to another, that they had an hundred and twenty fighting men kill'd this day,</p>
               <p>The same day (as is judged fifty) <hi>Indians</hi> burnt nineteen houses and barns at <hi>Situate</hi> in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony, but were notably encountred and repelled from doing further mischief by the valor of a few of the inhabitants.</p>

A small number of them near <hi>Woodcocks</hi> who keeps the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> in the Road to <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> watched their opportunity and killed his son, and another man, and greatly wounded another of his sons, and shot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self through the arm, and then burnt his sons house.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Boston</hi> there is a Press in order to sending forth another Army to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the enemy; for we hear there is a great body of them near <hi>Malbury,</hi> (as tis apprehended) of many hundreds.</p>
               <p>About this time, in <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony, Capt. <hi>Dennison</hi> with sixty six Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, and an hundred and twelve <hi>Pequod-Indinas,</hi> pursuing the common enemy, took and slew seventy and six <hi>Indians.</hi> Amongst the slain was the

They took and spoiled an hundred and sixty bushels of the <hi>Indians</hi> Corn. None of ours either <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Indians</hi> that did ingage with and for the <hi>English,</hi> were lost when this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit was done.</p>
               <p>In the month of <hi>April,</hi> many of the Eastern <hi>Indians</hi> having been sorely distressed, and fain to wander up and down for meat, so as that they lived for some time upon no other food then the skins of wild creatures, which they soaked in water till they became soft and eatable, notwithstanding the outrages and murthers (for they have shed the blood of about forty seven persons) by them committed, they did in confidence of favour from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish come and submit themselves, alleadging that the injuries done by them were grounded upon a mistake. For when a party of English came in a Warlike posture upon some of their <hi>Webbs</hi> (as they call them) <hi>i. e. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> as they were gathering Corn, an Indian seeing it, ran to the other Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and told them that the English had (though it were not at all so) killed all those Indian women, and therefore they took up arms to revenge that supposed injury. Also they plead for themselves, that a Fisher-man told one of them, that the <hi>English</hi> would destroy all the <hi>Indians,</hi> and when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was made of another <hi>English</hi> man (thought to be more discreet than the former) he confirmed what the other had said, and that some rude <hi>English</hi> did purposely over set a <hi>Canoo</hi> wherein was an <hi>Indian</hi> Lad; and that although a <hi>Squaw</hi> dived to the bottom of the River and fetched him up alive, yet that the Lad never came to himself again. It is greatly to be lamented that the Heathen should have any ground for such allegations, or that they should be scandalized by men that call themselves Christians.</p>

And whereas a special request left before the Lord this day, was, that he would (as a token for good) cause our poor Captives to be returned to us again, and particularly those that were taken from <hi>Haveril</hi> the last week, God gave a gracious and speedy Answer, bringing home those very Captives in particular, and many other, yea at least sixteen of our poor sighing <hi>Prisoners,</hi> who were appointed to death, did the Lord loose and return unto us, within eight weeks after this day, and divers of them within three days after this solemn day of Prayer. There are who have dated the turn of Providence towards us in this Colony, and against the Enemy in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, from this day forward: yet some lesser and more inconsiderable devastations happened soon after in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony.

In this Disorder, he that was at this time the chief Captain, whose name was <hi>Turner,</hi> lost his life, he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued through a River, received his fatal stroke as he passed through that which is called the <hi>Green River,</hi> and as he came out of the Water he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Uncircumcised, who stripped him (as some who say they saw it affirm) and rode away upon his horse, and between thirty and forty more were lost in this retreat.</p>
               <p>Within a few days after this, Captain <hi>Turner</hi>'s dead Corps was found a small distance from the River, it appeared that he had been shot through the thigh and back, of which it's judged he died speedily without any great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Enemy. However it were, it is evident that the English ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a victory at this time, yet if it be as some <hi>Indians</hi> have since related, the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40970:20"/> Victory was not so great as was at first apprehended: For sundry of them who were at several times taken after this slaughter affirm that many of the <hi>Indians</hi> that were driven down the Falls, got safe on shore again, and that they lost not above threescore men in the fight: also that they killed thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and eight <hi>English</hi> men, which indeed is just the number missing. There is not much heed to be given to <hi>Indian</hi> Testimony, yet when circumstances and artificial arguments confirm what they say, it becometh an impartial <hi>Historian</hi> to take notice thereof, nor is it to be doubted but the loss of the Enemy was greater than those Captives taken by our Forces abroad did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. Some other <hi>Indians</hi> said, that they lost several hundreds at this time, amongst whom there was one Sachem. I am informed that divers <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> who were in that battel, but since come in to the English at <hi>Norwich,</hi> say that there were three hundred killed at that time, which is also confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by an <hi>Indian</hi> called <hi>Pomham,</hi> who saith that of that three hundred there were an hundred and seventy fighting men. Whatever the victory or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of that engagement might be, it was the Lords doing, and let him alone have all the Glory.</p>

The <hi>Indians</hi> betook themselves to a River, and had not some Foot-Soldiers on the other side of the River, too sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered themselves, probably there had been a greater slaughter of the Enemy, who hasted out of the River again, and fled into a Swamp where there was no pursuing of them.</p>

                  <hi>May</hi> 30. The Enemy appeared at <hi>Hatfield,</hi> fired about twelve houses and barns without the Fortification, killed many of their Cattel, drave away almost all their Sheep, spread themselves in the meadow between <hi>Hatfield</hi> and <hi>Hadley.</hi> Whereupon twenty five active and resolute men went from <hi>Hadly</hi> to relieve their distressed Brethren. The <hi>Indians</hi> shot at them ere they could get out of the Boat, and wounded one of them. Ours nevertheless charged on the Enemy, shot down five or six at the first volley near the River. Then they made hast toward the town fighting with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Enemy, many falling before them. And though encompast with a numerous swarm of <hi>Indians,</hi> who lay in Ambush behind almost every tree, and place of advantage, yet the English lost not one man, till within about an hundred rod of the Town, when five of ours were slain; among whom was a precious young man, whose name was <hi>Smith,</hi> that place having lost many in losing that one man. It speaketh sadly to the rising Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when such are taken away. After this the Enemy fled, having lost five and twenty in this fight.</p>

               <p>In these two last months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> besides the <hi>Sword of War,</hi> in respect of the Heathen, <hi>the Sword of the Lord</hi> hath been drawn against this Land, in respect of Epidemical Diseases, which sin hath brought upon us; Sore and (doubtless) <hi>Malignant Colds</hi> prevailing every where. I cannot hear of one Family in <hi>New England</hi> that hath wholly escaped the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but there have been many Families wherein every one in the House was sick and ill disposed. So as that there have been many sick and weak, and some are fallen asleep, yea some eminent and useful Instruments hath the Lord removed, and made breaches thereby upon divers of the Colonies of <hi>New England.</hi>

                  <hi>Connecticut</hi> is deprived of their worthy and publick-spirited Governour <hi>Winthrop.</hi> This Colony of <hi>Mattachusets</hi> hath been bereaved of two, (<hi>viz.</hi> Major <hi>Willard</hi> and Mr. <hi>Russel</hi>) who for many years had approved themselves faithful in the Magistracy. And the death of a few such is as much as if thousands had fallen; yet many other righteous and useful ones are gone, leaving us behind in the storm. And amongst the common people, not a few have been carried to their Graves in these two last Months. We have heard of no less than eight in one small Plantation buried in one week, wherein also twenty persons died this Spring. And in another little Town nineteen persons have died within a few weeks. We in <hi>Boston</hi> have seen (a sad and solemn spectacle!) Coffins meeting one another, and three or four put into their Graves in one day. In the month of <hi>May</hi> about fifty persons are deceased in this Town. By which things, God from Heaven speaks to us and would give us to understand, that if the Sword will not reform us, he hath other Judgments in store, whereby he can suddenly and easily bring us down. The Lord help us to apply our hearts unto Wisdom, and make us thankful, in that he hath been intreated graciously and wonderfully to restore health unto us again.</p>
               <p>In the latter end of <hi>May</hi> and beginning of <hi>June,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> have been less active in the pursuit of their mischievous designs against the <hi>English.</hi> One reason whereof hath been, in that it was now their planting and fishing time: for at this time of the year, they supply themselves with fish out of the Ponds and Rivers wherewith this good Land doth abound, and dry it against the Sun, so as that they can lay up in store, for to serve them the year about. But it would have been no wisdom for the English to suffer them so to do. Wherefore about four or five hundred Soldiers were sent out of this Colony, and as many (<hi>English</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> together) of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to seek out and disrest the Enemy.</p>

               <p>Also <hi>Connecticut</hi> Forces, whilst upon their march, killed and took above fifty <hi>Indians:</hi> and not long after that, a small party of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Souldiers with the afsistance of a few of those <hi>Indians</hi> who have been friends to the <hi>English,</hi> slew and took forty and four of the Enemy in the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Country; all these exploits being performed without the loss of any of ours.</p>

Besides En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, there were near upon two hundred Indians in <hi>Hadley,</hi> who came to fight with and for the English, against the common enemy, who was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driven off at the <hi>South end</hi> of the Town, whilst our men were pursuing of them here, on a sudden a great Swarm of Indians issued out of the Bushes, and made their main assault at the <hi>North end</hi> of the Town, they fired a Barn which was without the Fortifications, and went into an house, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants discharged a great Gun upon them, whereupon about fifty Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were seen running out of the house in great haste, being terribly frighted with the Report and slaughter made amongst them by the great Gun. Ours followed the enemy (whom they judged to be about five hundred, and by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian report since, it seems they were seven hundred) neer upon two miles, and would fain have pursued them further, but they had no Order so to do. Some in those parts think, that as great an opportunity and advantage as enemy to them, and there being English and Indians enough to pursue them: But others supposing that then they should impede the design of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them at the <hi>Falls,</hi> nothing was done until it was too late, only the Towns in those places were eminently saved, and but few of ours that lost their lives in this Skirmish, nor is it as yet known how many the enemy lost in this fight. The English could find but three dead Indians: yet some of them who have been taken Captive, confess that they had thirty men kill'd this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40970:22"/> day. And since we have been informed by Indians, of that which is much to be observed, <hi>viz.</hi> that while the Indian men were thus fighting against <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> the hand of the Lord so disposed, as that the <hi>Mohawks</hi> came upon their Head-Quarters, and smote their Women and Children with a great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then returned with much plunder. If indeed it was so (and the Indians are under no temptation to report a falshood of this nature) it is a very memorable passage.</p>

               <p>It is certain, that before this War brake out; <hi>viz</hi> on Sept. 10. 1674. In <hi>Hadley, Northampton,</hi> and other Town thereabouts was heard the report of a great piece of Ordinance, with a shaking of the earth, and a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eccho, when as there was no Ordinance really discharged at or near any of those Towns at that time. Yea no less than seven years before this war there were plain prodigious <hi>Notices</hi> of it. For,</p>
               <p>Anno 1667. There were fears on the spirits of many of the English, concerning <hi>Philip</hi> and his Indians, and that year, Novemb. 30. about 9. or 10. <hi>ho.</hi> A. M. being a very clear, still, Sun-shine morning, there were divers Persons in <hi>Maldon,</hi> who heard in the air on the South-east of them, a great Gun go off, and as soon as that was past, they heard the report of small Guns like musket shot, discharging very thick, as if it had been at a general Training; but that which did most of all amaze them, was the flying of the Bullets that came singing over their heads, and seemed to be very near them, after this they heard drums passing by them and going Westward. The same day, at <hi>Scituate,</hi> (and in other places) in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony, they heard as it were the running of troops of horses.</p>
               <p>I would not have mentioned this relation, had I not received it from seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, faithful and judicious hands, even of those who were ear-witnesses of these things.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:40970:22"/>
               <p>And now that I am upon this <hi>Digression,</hi> let me add, that the monstrous births which have at sundry times hapned, are speaking solemn providences. Especially that which was at <hi>Woburn,</hi> Febru. 23. 1670. When the Wife of <hi>Joseph Wright</hi> was delivered of a Creature, the form thereof was as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <q rend="margQuotes">The head, neck and arms in true form and shape of a child, but it had no breast bone nor any back bone; the belly was of an extraordinary bigness, both the sides and back being like a belly, the thighs were very small without any thigh bones; It had no buttocks, the <hi>Membrum Virile</hi> was a meer bone; it had no passage for nature in any part below; the feet turned directly outward, the heels turned up, and like a bone, It being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, there were found two great lumps of flesh on the sides of the seeming belly; the bowels did lie on the upper part of the breast by the Vitals. </q> This was testified before the Deputy Governour Mr. <hi>Willoughby</hi> on the <hi>2d.</hi> of March following, by Mrs. <hi>Johnson</hi> Midwife, <hi>Mary Kendal, Ruth Bloghead, Lydia Kendal.</hi> Seen also by Capt. <hi>Edward Johnson.</hi> Lieut. <hi>John Carter, Henry Brook, James Thomson, Isaac Cole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are judicious persons, who upon the consideration of some rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive circumstances, in that monstrous birth, have concluded that God did thereby bear witness against the <hi>Disorders</hi> of some in that place. As in the days of our Fathers, it was apprehended that God did testifie from heaven against the monstrous Familistical Opinions that were then stirring, by that direful Monster which was brought forth by the wife of <hi>William Dyer,</hi> Octo. 17. 1637. a description whereof may be seen in Mr. <hi>Welds</hi> his History of the Rise and Ruine of Antinomianism. p. 43, 44. and in Mr. <hi>Clarks Examples</hi> vol. 1. p. 249.</p>
               <p>Certainly God would have such providences to be observed and recorded; He doth not send such things for nothing, or that no notice should be taken of them. And therefore was I willing to give a true account thereof, hoping that thereby mistakes and false Reports may be prevented.</p>

The next day it rained again, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a cold <hi>Euroclydon,</hi> or, <hi>North-east</hi> storm all that day and night, so that our Souldiers received much damage in their arms, ammunition and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and the next day (being Lords day) returned to the Towns, weary and discouraged, the Lord having seemed to fight against them by the storm mentioned.

                  <hi>June</hi> 29. Was observed as a day of publick <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to celebrate the praises of that God, who hath begun to answer Prayer. And although there is cause for Humiliation before the Lord, inasmuch as the Sword is still drawn against us, nevertheless we are under deep engagement to make his praise glorious; considering how wonderfully he hath restrained and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the insolency of the Heathen. That Victory which God gave to our Army, <hi>December</hi> 19. and again <hi>May</hi> 18. is never to be forgotten: also in that divers <hi>Indian Sachims</hi> (especially their great Sachim <hi>Quanonchet</hi>) have fallen before the Lord, and before his Servants. And in that things have been no worse with us, since the year of trouble hath been upon us, that no more Indians have been let loose upon us, but many of them have been our friends, that no more <hi>Plantations</hi> have been made <hi>desolate,</hi> which nothing but the restraining gracious providence of God hath prevented, for the Enemy might easily have destroyed ten times as many Towns as they have done, had not he that sets bounds to the raging of the Sea, restrained them; yea, <hi>one whole Colony</hi> hath been in a manner untouched, saving that one small deserted Plantation therein was burnt by the Indians; also sundry Towns
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40970:23"/> that have been fiercely assaulted by the Enemy, having obtained help from God, to continue to this day, as brands plucked out of the fire, and as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the sparing mercy of God, although they have been in the fire they are not consumed. And God hath returned many of our <hi>Captives,</hi> having given them to find compassion before them who led them Captive; and caused the Enemy to entreat them well, in the time of affliction, and in the time of evil, and by strange wayes at last delivered them. He hath also sent in a supply of Corn from beyond Sea, this Spring and before winter, without which we could not easily have sent out such Armies (however small and not worthy of the name of <hi>Armies</hi> in other parts of the World; yet with us they are Armies) as have been pursuing the Enemy. Its wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to consider, how that the Lord hath visited his People in giving them Bread, when a Famine was expected. And this Summer, God hath caused the shower to come down in its season, there have been showers of Blessing when some beginnings of a Drought were upon the Land. And sore Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases hath the Lord rebuked; whereas the <hi>small Pox</hi> and other <hi>Malignant</hi> and <hi>Contagious Distempers</hi> have been amongst us since this <hi>War</hi> began, God hath been entreated to have compassion on us, and to restore health unto his people. Moreover, we are still under the enjoyment of our <hi>Liberties,</hi> both Civil and Spiritual: for such causes as these, the day mentioned was observed (by order of the Council) as a day of publick Thanksgiving throughout this Colony: And behold when we began to sing and to praise the Lord whose mercy endureth for ever, he hath as it were set Ambush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against the Enemy, and they were smitten, yea they have since that been smiting and betraying one another.</p>
               <p>There are two things here observable:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas this very day of the Moneth (<hi>viz. June</hi> 29.) was kept as a day of publick <hi>Humiliation</hi> the last year, being the first <hi>Fast</hi> that was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in this Colony on the account of the present <hi>War,</hi> God hath so orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as that the same day of the moneth was in the year after set apart to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his Name on the account of mercies received, being the first publick day of Thanksgiving, which hath been attended throughout this Colony since the <hi>War</hi> began.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord from Heaven smiled upon us at this time; for the day before this <hi>Thanks-giving,</hi> as also the day after, he gave us to hear of more of our Captives returned; particularly Mr. <hi>Rowlandsons</hi> Children are now brought in as answers of Prayer. It is not a small mercy, that the mother and children (only one child was killed when the other were taken) should all of them be saved alive, and carried through the Jaws of so many deaths, and at last brought home in peace, that so they and all that ever shall hear of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40970:24"/> it, might see and know, that the Lord Jehovah, is a God that heareth prayer Also the night after this <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> intelligence came to <hi>Boston,</hi> that a chief <hi>Narraganset Sachim</hi> is now suing to the English for peace, and that an Indian was come in to the English near <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> who informed that <hi>Philip</hi> was not far off, and that he had but thirty men (besides Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) with him; and promised to conduct the English to the place where <hi>Philip</hi> was lurking, and might probably be taken; Moreover, the Indian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that those Indians who are known by the name of <hi>Mauquawogs</hi> (or Mohawks, <hi>i. e.</hi> Man-eaters had lately fallen upon <hi>Philip,</hi> and killed fifty of his men. And if the variance between <hi>Philip</hi> &amp; the <hi>Mauquawogs</hi> came to pass, as is commonly reported &amp; apprehended, there was a marvelous finger of God in it. For we hear that <hi>Philip</hi> being this winter entertained in the <hi>Mohawks</hi> Country, made it his design to breed a quarrel betwen the English and them; to effect which divers of our returned Captives do report that he resolved to kill some scattering <hi>Mohawks,</hi> and then to say that the English had done it: but one of those whom he thought to have killed, was onl wounded, and got away to his Country-men, giving them to understand, that not the English but <hi>Philip</hi> had killed the Men that were Murdered, so that in stead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Mohawks</hi> upon the English, he brought them upon himself. Thus hath he conceived mischief and brought forth falshood, he made a pit and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he hath made, his mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. The Heathen are sunk down into the pit that they made, in the net which they had hid, is their own foot taken; the Lord is known by the Judgment which he executeth, the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. <hi>Higgaion.</hi> Selah.</p>

                  <hi>June</hi> 30. This day Souldiers marched out of <hi>Boston</hi> towards the place, where <hi>Philip</hi> was supposed to be. But when they came thither, they found that he was newly gone. We hear that he is returned to <hi>Mount-hope,</hi> and that a considerable body of Indians are gathered to that place, where the <hi>War</hi> began, and where (it may be) way must be made towards an end of these troubles. Yet who knoweth how cruelly a <hi>dying Beast</hi> may bite before his expiration? Also <hi>Plimouth</hi> Companies being abroad under the conduct of Major <hi>Bradford,</hi> the Lord went forth with them, this day cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the enemy to fall before them. They were in danger of being cut off by a party of Indians who lay in Ambush for that end, but some of the <hi>Cape-Indians,</hi> who have been faithful to the English, discovered the <hi>Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems</hi> of the Adversary, whereby their intended mischief was happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. Divers of them were killed and taken, without the loss of so much as one of ours. And whereas, three Messengers from <hi>Squaw Sachem</hi> of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40970:24"/>
                  <hi>Sakonet,</hi> were gone to the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> offering to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and engaging Fidelity to the English for the suture, if they might but have a promise of life, and liberty; before the Messengers returued from their treaty, that <hi>Squaw-Sachim</hi> with about <hi>ninety</hi> persons, hearing that <hi>Plimouth</hi> Forces were approaching to them, came and rendred themselves to Major <hi>Bradford;</hi> wholly submitting to mercy, so that this day were killed, taken, and brought in no less then <hi>an hundred and ten Indians.</hi> And the providence of God herein is the more observable, in that the very day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, the Lords People in <hi>Plimouth</hi> did unanimously consent to renew their Covenant with God, and one another, and a day of Humiliation was appointed for that end, that so a work so sacred and awful might be attended with the more solemnity; also in the week before these signal smiles from Heaven upon that <hi>Colony,</hi> most of the Churches there, had <hi>renewed their Covenant,</hi> viz. on the day of <hi>Humiliation</hi> which was last attended through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that jurisdiction. God then saith unto us, that if we will indeed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto his voice, the haters of the Lord shall soon submit themselves.</p>

                  <hi>July</hi> 1. Whereas the Council at <hi>Boston</hi> had lately emitted a Declaration, signifying, that such Indians as did within fourteen dayes come in to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, might hope for mercy, divers of them did this day return from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Nupmicks.</hi> Amongst others, <hi>James</hi> an Indian, who could not only read, and write, but had learned the Art of Priuting, notwithstanding his Apostasie, did venture himself upon the mercy and truth of the English Declaration which he had seen and read, promising for the future to venture his life against the common Enemy. He and the other now come in, affirm that very many of the Indians are dead sicne this <hi>War</hi> began, and that more have dyed by the hand of God, in respect of Diseases, Fluxes, and Feavers, which have been amongst them, than have been killed with the Sword.</p>

The English would gladly have gone further, and have joined with <hi>Boston</hi> and <hi>Plimouth</hi> Companies to pursue <hi>Philip</hi> at <hi>Mount-hope,</hi> but the <hi>Connecticut</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians would by no means be perswaded thereunto, until such time as they had returned home with the booty they had taken.

                  <hi>July.</hi> 6. Five or six Indian <hi>Sachems</hi> did make peace with the English in the Eastern parts of this Colony. They have brought in with them three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men besides women and children. One of the <hi>Sachims</hi> did earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that the English would promise that no more <hi>liquors</hi> should be sold or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Indians,</hi> that so they might not be in a Capacity of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves drunk, having fouud by woful experience, that that hath been a ruining evil to many of them. This week also about <hi>two hundred Indians</hi> more came and submitted themselves to mercy, in <hi>Plimouth Colony,</hi> being partly necessitated thereeuto by the distresses which God in his holy providence hath brought them into, and partly encouraged by a promise from the Government there, that all such Indians as would come in and lay down their arms should have life and liberty granted to them, excepting only such as had been active in any of the murthers which have been committed. When these Indians were in the hands of the English, a certain <hi>Squaw</hi> amongst them, perceiving that it would be pleasing to the English, if the murderers were discovered, she presently told of one who had had a bloudy hand in the murthers which were done in Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> house <hi>March</hi> the twelfth, the Indian immediately confessed the Fact, only said that there was another who had as great a hand therein as he, which other Indian being examined confessed the thing also, and he revealed a third Indian Murderer, who upon Examination owned the thing, whereupon they were all three forth with executed, thus did God bring upon them the innocent blood which they had shed. Also the Indians who had surrendred themselves, informed that a bloody Indian called <hi>Tuckpoo</hi> (who the last summer murdered a man of <hi>Boston</hi> at <hi>Namasket</hi>) with about twenty <hi>Indians</hi> more, was at a place within 16 miles of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and manifested willingness to go and fetch him in, whereupon eight English with fourteen Indians, marched out in the night, and seized upon them all, none of ours receiving any hurt at this time. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice was speedily executed upon the Indian, who had been a murderer; the other having their lives granted them.</p>

                  <hi>July</hi> 7. A small party of our Indians having some English with them, took and killed seven of the Enemy in the Woods beyond <hi>Dedham,</hi> whereof one was a petty <hi>Sachem.</hi> The two Indians which were then taken Prisoners, say that many of their men who were sent to <hi>Albany</hi> for a supply of Powder, were set upon in the way by the <hi>Mobawks,</hi> and killed,. It is is certain that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time, some of those <hi>Indians</hi> who are in <hi>Hostility</hi> against the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish (amongst whom the <hi>Sachim</hi> of <hi>Springfield</hi> Indians, was one) came to <hi>Albany</hi> to buy Powder, and that they might effect their design, they lyed and said, that now they had made peace with the English, and desired Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only to go an hunting in the Woods: we hear, that the other Indians
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40970:25"/> were very desirous to have slain them, but the Governour of <hi>New-York</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them, and gave notice to the Councill at <hi>Hartford:</hi> since that we have Intelligence that many of our enemies, yea and such as have been notorious Murderers, are fled for refuge to those about <hi>Albany.</hi>

                  <hi>July</hi> 11. A Party of Indians ('tis conjectured that there were about two hundred of them) assaulted <hi>Taunton.</hi> And in probability, that Town had at this time been brought under the same desolation other places have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, had not the Lord in his gracious providence so ordered, that a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Negro,</hi> the week before escaped from <hi>Philip,</hi> and informed of his purpose speedily to destroy <hi>Taunton;</hi> whereupon Souldiers were forth with sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so that the enemy was in a little time repulsed, and fled, after they had fired two Houses: but not one English Life was lost in this Engagement. What loss the enemy sustained is as yet unknown to us. There was a speciall providence in that <hi>Negroes</hi> escape, for he having lived many years near to the <hi>Indians,</hi> understood their Language, and having heard them tell one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what their designs were, he acquainted the English therewith, and how <hi>Philip</hi> had ordered his men to lye in <hi>Ambuscadoes</hi> in such places, to cut off the English, who by means of this intelligence escaped that danger, which otherwise had attended them.</p>
               <p>About this time we hear that there are three hundred <hi>Mohaugs,</hi> who have armed themselves, as being desirous to be revenged upon those Indians who have done so much harm to <hi>New-England</hi> (if they receive no discouragement as to their designed Expedition) And that they purpose to <hi>colous</hi> their heads and make them <hi>yellow,</hi> that so they may not upon their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to any of our Plantations, be mistaken for other <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another thing which though it doe not concern the Warr, yet hapning this week, it may not be amiss here to take notice of it. At <hi>Saco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesset</hi> in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony, a female Child was born with two heads, perfectly distinct each form other, so that it had four eyes, and four ears, and two mouthes and tongues, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>July</hi> 22. Some of our Companies returned from <hi>Mount-hope</hi> to <hi>Boston,</hi> And albeit they have not attained that which was the main end proposed in their going forth, <hi>sc.</hi> the Apprehension of <hi>Philip,</hi> nevertheless God was in a gratious measure present with them; for they killed and took about an hundred and fifty <hi>Indians</hi> in this expedition, with the loss of but one <hi>English man.</hi> One night they lodged very near unto <hi>Philip,</hi> but he kept himself private and still in a <hi>Swamp,</hi> ours not imagining that he had been so neer, as afterwards (by <hi>Indian</hi> Captives) they perceived he was: after this an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> that was taken Prisoner engaged that if they would spare his life, he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40970:26"/> would forthwith bring them to <hi>Philip,</hi> but our Souldiers were not able to go the nearest way towards him, yet in about two hours space, they came whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Indian conducted them, and found that a great many Indians were newly fled, having for hast left their <hi>Kettles</hi> boyling over their fires, and their Belts, and Baskets of <hi>Wampampeag,</hi> yea and their dead unburied. At that time did the English take and kill about feventy persons: since an Indian that came into <hi>Rhode-Island,</hi> informeth, that <hi>Philip</hi> is gone to a Swamp near <hi>Dartmouth:</hi> and that when our Forces were pursuing of him, he with a few hid himself in <hi>Squanakunk</hi> Swamp, till our Souldiers were past, and then with one Indian in a <hi>Canoo</hi> crost the river to <hi>Pocasset.</hi> It seems the body of the Indians belonging to him, went over on two Rafts, in which passage they lost severall Guns, and wet much of their Ammunition. The reason why <hi>Philip</hi> fled to this place, was because if he went <hi>Northward,</hi> the <hi>Mohawks</hi> would be upon him, if <hi>Southward</hi> he was in danger of the <hi>Monbegins,</hi> and he durst not hide himself any longer about <hi>Metapoisit,</hi> because the Woods thereabouts were filled with Souldiers. This week also, Captain <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> with a finall party consisting of about eighteen English, and two and twenty Indians, had four severall engagements with the Enemy, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and took Captive seventy nine Indians, without the loss of so much as one of ours; it having been his manner, when he taketh any Indians by a promise of favour to them, in case they acquit themselves well, to set them an hunting after more of these Wolves, whereby the worst of them, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do singular good service in finding out the rest of their bloody fellows. In one of these Skirmishes, <hi>Tiashq, Philips</hi> chief Captain, ran away leaving his Gun behind him, and his <hi>Squaw,</hi> who was taken. They came within two miles of the place where <hi>Philip</hi> hideth himself, and discerned at a distance about fifty Indians with Guns, thought to be <hi>Philips</hi> Hunters for provision, and were desirous to have engaged with them, but being loaden with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and plunder, they could not thenattend it. Also a <hi>Sachim</hi> of <hi>Pocasset</hi> hath submitted himself with fourty Indians more, to the Governour of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> So that there is of late such a strange <hi>turn of providence</hi> (especially in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony, since the Churches in that Colony (being thereunto provoked by the godly advice and Recommendation of the civil Authority in that Jurisdiction) did solemnly <hi>renew their covenant with God and one another</hi>) as the like hath rarely been heard of in any age. Whereas formerly almost every week did conclude with sad tidings, now the Lord sends us good news weekly. Without doubt, there are in the World who have been praying for us, and God hath heard them. If our poor prayers may be a means to obtain mercy for them also, who have prayed for us, how shall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,

                  <hi>July</hi> 25. Thirty and six English-men who went out of <hi>Medfield</hi> and <hi>Ded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> having nine of the <hi>Praying Indians</hi> with them, pursued and overtook a party of the Enemy, killed and took alive fifty of them, without the loss of any of ours. The nine Indians stored themselves with plunder when this exploit was done: For besides Kettles, there was about half a bushel of <hi>Wampampeag,</hi> which the Enemy lost, and twelve pound of Powder, which the Captives say they had received from <hi>Albany</hi> but two days before. At this time another of the <hi>Narraganset Sachims</hi> was killed, whose name was <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his Son was taken alive, and brought Prisoner to <hi>Boston.</hi> This <hi>Pomham</hi> after he was wounded so as that he could not stand upon his legs, and was thought to have been dead, made a shift (as the Souldiers were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing others) to crawl a little out of the way, but was found again; and when an <hi>English-man</hi> drew near to him, though he could not stand, he did (like a dying Beast) in rage and revenge, get hold on that Souldiers head, and had like to have killed him, had not another came in to his help, and rescued him out of the enraged dying hands of that bloody Barbarian, who had been a great promoter of the <hi>Narraganset</hi> War.</p>

                  <hi>July</hi> 27. One of the <hi>Nipmuck Sachims</hi> (called <hi>Sagamore John</hi>) came to <hi>Boston,</hi> and submitted himself to the mercy of the <hi>English,</hi> bringing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred and fourscore <hi>Indians</hi> with him. And that so he might ingratiate himself with the <hi>English,</hi> he apprehended <hi>Matoonas</hi> and his Son, and brought them with him to <hi>Boston,</hi> which <hi>Matoonas</hi> was the beginner of the War in this Colony of <hi>Massachusets;</hi> for it was he that committed the murders which were done at <hi>Mendam, July</hi> 14. 1675. Being thus taken and examined before the Council, he had little to plead for himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was condemned to immediate death. <hi>Sagamore John</hi> was desirous that he and his men might be the Executioners; wherefore <hi>Matoonas</hi> was carried out into the Common at <hi>Boston,</hi> and there being tied to a Tree, the <hi>Sachim</hi> who had now submitted himself, with several of his men, shot him to death. Thus did the Lord (a year after) retaliate upon him the innocent blood which he had shed, as he had done so God hath requited him: And inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Matoonas,</hi> who began the War and Mischiefs which have followed thereon in this Colony of <hi>Massachusets</hi> is taken, and Justice glorified upon him, it seems to be a good <hi>Omen,</hi> that ere long <hi>Philip</hi> who began the War in the other Colony, shall likewise be delivered up unto Justice. In due time his foot shall slide, and the things which shall come upon him seem to make haste.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 31. A small party of Souldiers, whose hearts God had touched, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> in order to pursuing the Enemy. And (about 3 <hi>h. p. m.</hi>) not far from <hi>Tetignot River,</hi> they unexpectedly to themselves, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerned by the Enemy, came upon a company of Indians, amongst whom <hi>Philip</hi> himself was, though his being there was not known to our men, until the engagement was over. They shot down ten Indians, they were well armed, and at first snapped their Guns at the English, but not one of them took fire; wherefore the terrour of God fell upon the Indians, that fifteen of them threw down their Guns, and submitted themselves to the English, the rest fled; <hi>Philip</hi> himself escaped very narrowly with his life. He threw away his stock of Powder into Bushes, that he might hasten his escape, albeit some of his men the next day found it again. Our Souldiers took above twenty pound of Bullets and Lead, and seven Guns, five of which were loaden and primed: yea they took the chief of <hi>Philips</hi> Treasure, not being able to carry away all their Plunder that day, for they found much English goods which <hi>Philip</hi> had stolen. <hi>Philip</hi> made his escape with three men, one of which was killed. And although he himself got clear, yet his Uncle, whose name was <hi>Æ²ncompoen,</hi> being one of his chief Counsellors, was slain, and <hi>Philips</hi> own Sister was taken Prisoner: not so much as one En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-man received any hurt at this time. Thus did God own <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> after the People therein had subscribed with their hands, and solemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their holy Covenant with God, and one another, that they would reform those evils which were amongst them, and endeavour for the future to walk more according to the will of God in Jesus Christ.</p>

The next morning they came upon <hi>Philips</hi> head Quarters, killed and took about and hundred and thirty Indians, with the loss of but one En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-man. In probability many of the English Souldiers had been cut off at this time, but that an Indian called <hi>Matthias,</hi> who fought for the English, when they were come very near the Enemy, called to them in their own Language with much vehemency, telling them they were all dead men if they did but fire a Gun, which did so amuse and amaze the Indians, that they lost a great advantage against the English. <hi>Philip</hi> hardly escaped with his life this day also. He fled and left his <hi>Peag</hi> behind him, also his <hi>Squaw</hi> and his Son were taken Captives, and are now Prisoners in <hi>Plymouth.</hi> Thus hath God brought that grand Enemy into great misery before he quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story him.

                  <hi>August.</hi> 3. This day the Lord smiled upon this Land by signal favour, in another respect which concerns not the present War. For whereas in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> there had been a sore Drought, which did greatly threaten the Indian Harvest, God opened the bottles of Heaven, and caused it to rain all this night, and the day after, so as that the Indian corn is recovered to admiration, the English Harvest being already gathered in, and more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than in some former years, insomuch that this which was expected to be a year of Famine, is turned to be a year of plenty as to provision.</p>
               <p>Whilst I am writing this, good information is brought to me, that in some parts of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony, the Drought was sorer than in this Colony, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Trecs began to languish, and the Indians to despair of an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest; wherefore <hi>Æ²ncas</hi> (for although he be a friend to the English, yet he and all his men continue <hi>Pagans</hi> still) set his <hi>Powaws</hi> on work to see if they could by powawing (i. e. conjuring) procure rain, but all in vain; He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent Westward to a noted <hi>Powaw,</hi> to try his skill, but neither could that Wizzard by all his hideous and diabolical howlings obtain showers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he (i. e. <hi>Æ²ncas</hi>) applyed himself to Mr. <hi>Fitch</hi> (the Faithful and able Teacher of the Church in <hi>Norwich</hi>) desiring that he would pray to God for rain. Mr. <hi>Fitch</hi> replyed to him, that if he should do so, and God should do so, and God should hear him, as long as their <hi>Powaws</hi> were at work, they would ascribe the rain to them, and think that the Devil whom the Indians worship, and not God, had sent that rain, and therefore he would not set himself to pray for it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they had done with their vanities and witcheries. <hi>Æ²ncas</hi> and his Son <hi>Oweneco</hi> declared that they had left off <hi>Powawing,</hi> despairing to obtain what they desired. Mr. <hi>Fitch</hi> therefore called his Church together, and they set themselves by Fasting and Prayer, to ask of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain, and behold! that very night, and the next day, He that saith to the small rain, and to the great rain of his Strength, be thou upon the earth, gave most Plentiful Showers, in as much as the Heathen were affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, acknowledging that the God whom we serve is a great God, and there is none like unto him.</p>

An Indian that deserted his fellows, informed the Inhabitants of <hi>Taunton</hi> that a party of Indians who might be easily surprised, were not very far off, and promised to conduct any that had a mind to apprehend those Indians in the right way towards them, whereupon about twenty Souldiers marched out of <hi>Taunton,</hi> and they took all those Indians, being in number thirty and six, only the <hi>Squaw-Sachem</hi> of <hi>Pocasset,</hi> who was next
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40970:28"/> unto <hi>Philip</hi> in respect of the mischief that hath been done, and the blood that hath been shed in this Warr, escaped alone; but not long after some of <hi>Taunton</hi> finding an Indian Squaw in <hi>Metapoiset</hi> newly dead, cut off her head, and it hapned to be <hi>Weetamoo,</hi> i. e. <hi>Squaw-Sachem</hi> her <hi>head.</hi> When it was set upon a pole in <hi>Taunton,</hi> the Indians who were prisoners there, knew it presently, and made a most horrid and diabolical Lamentation, crying out it was their Queens head. Now here it is to be observed, that God himself by his own hand, brought this enemy to destruction. For in that place, where the last year, she furnished <hi>Philip</hi> with Canooes for his men, she her self could not meet with a Canoo, but venturing over the River upon a Raft, that brake under her, so that she was drowned, just before the English found her.

                  <hi>August.</hi> 12. This is the memorable day wherein <hi>Philip,</hi> the perfidious and bloudy Author of the War and wofull miseries that have thence ensued, was taken and slain, And God brought it to pass, chiefly by Indians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For one of <hi>Philips</hi> men (being disgusted at him, for killing an Indian who had propounded an expedient for peace with the English) ran away from him, and coming to Road-Island, informed that <hi>Philip</hi> was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> and undertook to bring them to the Swamp where he hid himself. Providence so disposed, as that Capt. <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Plymouth</hi> was then in Road-Island, in order to recruiting his Souldiers, who had been wearied with a tedious march that week, But immediately upon this Intelligence, he set forth again, with a small company of English and Indians. It seemeth that night <hi>Philip</hi> (like the man in the Host of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean</hi>) dreamed that he was fallen into the hands of the English, and just as he was saying to those that were with him, that they must fly for their lives that day, lest the Indian that was gone from him should discover where he was; Our Souldiers came upon him, and surrounded the <hi>Swamp</hi> (where he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40970:28"/> with seven of his men absconded) Thereupon he betook himself to flight; but as he was coming out of the Swamp, an English-man and an Indian endca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to fire at him, the English-man missed of his aime, but the Indian shot him through the heart, so as that he fell down dead. The Indian who thus killed <hi>Philip,</hi> did formerly belong to Squaw-Sachim of <hi>Pocasset,</hi> being known by the name of <hi>Alderman.</hi> In the beginning of the war, he came to the Governour of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> manifesting his desire to be at peace with the English, and immediately withdrew to an Island, not having ingaged against the English nor for them, before this time. Thus when <hi>Philip</hi> had made an end to deal treacherously, his own Subjects dealt treacherously with him. This Wo was brought upon him that spoyled when he was not spoyled. And in that very place where he first contrived and began his mischief, was he taken and destroyed, and there was he (like as Agag was hewed in pieces before the Lord) cut into four quarters, and is now hanged up as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of revenging Justice, his head being cut off and carried away to <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> his Hands were brought to <hi>Boston. So let all thine Enemies perish O Lord!</hi> When <hi>Philip</hi> was thus slain, five of his men were killed with him, one of which was his chief Captains son, being (as the Indians testifie) that very Indian, who shot the first gun at the English, when the War began. So that we may hope that the War in those parts will dye with <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little before this, the Authority in that Colony had appointed the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of this instant to be observed as a day of <hi>publick Thanksgiving</hi> throughout that Jurisdiction, on the account of wonderful success against the Enemy, which the Lord hath blessed them with, <hi>ever since they renewed their Covenant</hi> with him; and that so they might have hearts raised and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in ascribing praises to God, he delivered <hi>Philip</hi> into their hands a few dayes before their intended Thanksgiving. Thus did God break the head of that Leviathan, and gave it to be meet to the people inhabiting the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and brought it to the Town of <hi>Plimouth</hi> the very day of their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Festival: yet this also is to be added and considered, that the Lord (so great is the divine faithsulness) to prevent us from being lifted up with our successes, and that we might not become secure, so ordered as that not an English-man but an Indian (though under <hi>Churches</hi> influence) must have the honour of killing <hi>Philip.</hi> And the day before this, was attended with a doleful Tragedy in the Eastern parts of this Country; <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Falmouth</hi> in <hi>Casco-bay,</hi> where some of those treacherous and bloody Indians who had lately submitted themselves, and promised Fidelity to the English, killed and took Captive above thirty Souls. The chief Author of this mischief, was an Indian called <hi>Simon;</hi> who was once in the hands of the English, and then
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40970:29"/> known to have been active in former Murders, having bragged and boasted of the mischief and murders done by him: we may fear, that God, who so awfully threatned <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he had let go out of his hand a Blasphemous Murderous Heathen, whom the Lord had devoted to destruction, was not well pleased with the English for concluding this, and other bloody Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, in the late Eastern peace. What the issue of this new flame thus break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, shall be, or how far it shall proceed, is with him whose wisdom is infinite, and who doth all things well.</p>
               <p>Thus have we a brief, plain, and true Story of the War with the Indians in <hi>New-England,</hi> how it began, and how it hath made its progress; and what present hopes there are of a comfortable closure and conclusion of this trouble; which hath been continued for a whole year and more. Designing only a <hi>Breviary of the History of this war;</hi> I have not enlarged upon the circumstances of things, but shall leave that to others, who have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and leasure to go on with such an undertaking.</p>

               </q>
               <p>There is one thing admirable to consider; I mean the providence of God in keeping one of these three <hi>Æ²nited Colonies,</hi> in a manner untouched all this while: For <hi>Connecticut Colony</hi> hath not been assaulted by this Enemy, only a few houses in one deserted Plantation were burnt; and it is possible that one Indian alone might do that. Whether God intends another tryal for them, or for what reason he hath hither to spared them, no one may as yet determine. Christ said unto <hi>Peter, What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter:</hi> even so, although we do not at present fully perceive the meaning of this providence, yet hereafter it will be manifest. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the same sins and provocations have been found with them that are to be charged upon others, nevertheless it must needs be acknowledged (for why should not that which is praise-worthy in Brethren be owned, that so God may have the glory of his grace towards and in his Servants?) they have in the management of this affair, acquitted themselves like men, and like Christians. It was prudently done of them, not to make the <hi>Indians</hi> who lived amongst them their Enemies, and the Lord hath made them to be as a Wall to them, and also made use of them to do great service against the common Enemies of the English. The Churches there have also given proof of their charity and Christianity, by a liberal Contribution towards
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40970:29"/> the necessity of the Saints impoverished by this War in the other two Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ies, having collected and transported above a thousand Bushels of Corn, for the relief and comfort of those that have lost all through the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of War; God will remember and reward that pleasant fruit. Nor have some of the Churches in this Colony (especially in <hi>Boston,</hi> which the Grace of Christ hath alwayes made exemplary in works of that nature) been unwilling to consider their poor Brethren according to their Ability.</p>
               <p>To Conclude this <hi>History,</hi> it is evident by the things which have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, that our deliverance is as yet perfected; for the <hi>Nipmuck</hi> Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are not yet wholly subdued: Moreover, it will be a difficult thing, either to subdue, or to come at the <hi>River Indians,</hi> who have many of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themselves, and are gone far westward, and whilst they and others that have been in hostility against us, remain unconquered, we cannot enjoy such perfect peace as in the years which are past. And there seems to be a dark Cloud rising from the East, in respect of Indians in those parts, yea a Cloud which streameth forth blood. But that which is the saddest thought of all, is, that of late some unhappy scandals have been, which are enough to stop the current of mercy, which hath been flowing in upon us, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to let loose more Enemies upon us, so as that the second error shall be worse then the first. Only God doth deliver for his own Names sake: the Lord will not forsake his people for his great Names sake; because it hath pleased the Lord to make us his people. And we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to conclude that <hi>Salvation is begun,</hi> and in a gracious measure carried on towards us. For since last <hi>March</hi> there are two or 3000. <hi>Indians</hi> who have been either killed, or taken, or submitted themselves to the English. And those <hi>Indians</hi> which have been taken Captive; &amp; others also, inform that the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragansets</hi> are in a manner rnined, there being (as they say) not above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men left of them, who the last year were the greatest body of Indians in <hi>New-England,</hi> and the most formidable Enemy which hath appeared against us. But God hath consumed them by the Sword, and by Famine, and by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it being no unusual thing for those that traverse the woods to find dead Indians up and down, whom either Famine, or sickness, hath caused to dy, and there hath been none to bury them. And <hi>Philip</hi> who was the <hi>Sheba,</hi> that began and headed the Rebellion, his head is thrown over the wall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we good reason to hope that this <hi>Day of Trouble,</hi> is near to an end, if our sins doe not undoe all that hath been wrought for us. And indeed there is one sad consideration, which may cause humble tremblings to think of it, namely in that the <hi>Reformation</hi> which God expects from us it not so
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40970:30"/> hearty and so perfect as ought to be. Divines observe, that whereas upon <hi>Samuels exhortations,</hi> the people did make but imperfect work of it, as to the <hi>Reformation</hi> of provoking evils, therefore God did only begin their deliverance by <hi>Samuel,</hi> but left scattered <hi>Philistines</hi> unsubdued, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made head and proved a sore scourge to the Children of Israel, untill <hi>Davids</hi> time, in whose Reign there was a full Reformation, and then did the Lord give unto his people full deliverance. Nevertheless a sad <hi>Cantstrophe</hi> will attend those that shall magnifie themselves against the people of the Lord of Hosts. It hath been observed by many, that never any (whether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians or others) did set themselves to do hurt to <hi>New-England,</hi> but they have come to lamentable ends at last. <hi>New-England</hi> hath been a burthensome stone, all that have burthened themselves with it, have been cut in pieces. The experience of the present day, doth greatly confirm that observation, and give us ground to hope, that as for remaining enemies, they shall fare as others that have gone before them, have done. Yet this further must needs be acknowledged, that as to <hi>Victories</hi> obtained, we have no cause to glory in any thing that we have done, but rather to be ashamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded for our own wayes. The Lord hath thus far been our Saviour for his Names sake, that it might not be profaned among the Heathen whither he hath brought us. And God hath let us see that he could easily have destroyed us, by such a contemptible enemy as the Indians have been in our eyes; yea he hath convinced us that we-our selves could not subdue them. They have advantages that we have not, knowing where to find us, but we know not where to find them, who nevertheless are alwayes at home, and have in a manner nothing but their lives and souls (which they think not of) to lose; every Swamp is a Castle to them, and they can live comfortably on that which would starve English-men. So that <hi>we have no cause to glory,</hi> for it is God which hath thus saved us, and not we our selves. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the time when the enemy hath fallen, we must needs own that the Lord hath done it. For we expected (and could in reason expect no other) that when the Summer was come on, and the bushes and leaves of trees come forth, the enemy would do ten times more mischief then in the winter season; whenas since that, the Lord hath appeared against them, that they have done but little hurt comparatively. Had there not been, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine hand beyond all expectation manifested, we had been in a state most miserable this day. Also if we keep in mind the means and way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our deliverance hath thus been accomplished, we must needs own the Lord in all. For it hath not been brought to pass by our numbers, or skill, or valour, <hi>we have not got the Land in possession by our own Sword, neither did
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40970:30"/> our omn arm save us,</hi> But God hath wasted the Heathen, by sending the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Angel amongst them, since this War began; and (which should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be an humbling consideration unto us) much hath been done towards the subduing of the enemy, by the Indians who have fought for us, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more then by the English. And no doubt but that a great reason why many of them have of late been desirous to submit themselves to the English, hath been, because they were afraid of the <hi>Mohaugs</hi> who have a long time been a Terror to the other Indians. I have received it from one who was returned out of Captivity this Summer, that the Indians where he was, would not suffer any fires to be made in the night, for fear lest the <hi>Mohaugs</hi> should thereby discern where they were, and cut them off.</p>
               <p>Now, as the Lord, who doth redeem Israel out of all his troubles, hath graciously and gloriously begun our Salvation, so let him perfect it, in such a way, as that no honour at all may come unto us, but that great glory may be to his own blessed Name for ever. Let him bring health and cure unto this <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and reveal the abundance of peace and truth: And it shall be unto him a Name of joy, a Praise and an honour before all the Nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that he will doe unto us, and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness, and for all the prosperity that he will procure. If we hearken to his voice in these his solemn Dispensations, it surely shall be so. <hi>Not unto us O Lord; not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory, for thy mercy and for thy Truths sake,</hi> Amen!</p>

            <p>SInce I wrote the preceding Narrative, I hear that there are who make a scruple of using the word <hi>Army,</hi> when applyed to such inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Forces,</hi> as those which have been raised and sent forth by us in the late War. I pretend not to any skill or accuracy of speaking as to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern platforms of <hi>Military Discipline:</hi> But sure I am that of old, a few <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts</hi> being under the command of a chief Captain, though in all there were not above four or five hundred Souldiers, this was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, an <hi>Army, Acts</hi> 23. 27. Yea those three hundred Souldiers who were under <hi>Gideon</hi> as their <hi>General,</hi> are styled an <hi>Army, Judg.</hi> 8. 6. The Hebrew word there used cometh from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> which signifies <hi>turmatim congregare ad militandum,</hi> when Troops are assembled together, this did the Hebrews call an <hi>Host</hi> or an <hi>Army.</hi> There are small <hi>Armies</hi> as well as great ones, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 24. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> which is the word used in that place signifies <hi>Forces:</hi> that term have I commonly chosen, though the other being of most frequent use, and aptly enough expressing what is meant by it, I have not wholly declined it. For amongst us</p>
            <q>
               <l>â€”<hi>Sic volet usus</hi>
               </l>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>And Reason saith, that those <hi>Forces</hi> may pass for <hi>Armies</hi> in one part of the world, that will not do so in another. But my design in this <hi>Postscript</hi> is not to Criticize or Apologize about the use of a Term. There is another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greater importance, sc. <hi>That which doth concern the Grounds of this Warr, and the justness of it on our part:</hi> concerning which I shall here adde a few words, It is known to every one, that the <hi>Warr</hi> began not amongst us in <hi>Matachusets</hi> Colony; nor do the Indians (so far as I am informed) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that we have done them wrong. And therefore the cause on our part is most clear, and unquestionable: For if we should have suffered our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and those that were ready to be slain, to be drawn to death and not have endeavoured to deliver them, when they sent unto us for that end, the Lord would have been displeased; nor should we have acted like the Children of Abraham, Gen. 14. 14. Yea, all the world would justly have condemned us And as for our Brethren in that Colony, where these tumults first hapned,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40970:32"/> It is evident that the Indians did most unrighteously begin a Quarrel, and take up the Sword against them.</p>
            <p>I said at the beginning, I would not enlarge upon that Argument, which concerns the <hi>Grounds of the War;</hi> neither will I, because that would make the History too voluminous, contrary to my design. Nevertheless inasmuch as some are dissatisfied thereabouts, so as to receive impressions and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices in their minds, concerning our Brethren in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony (as it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for men in trouble to lay blame upon every body but themselves) sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that they have without just cause engaged themselves and all these united Colonies in an unhappy War. Yea and that the Indians were provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to do what they did, when as (whatever may be said of some private persons, of whose injurious dealings no complaint was made and proved) it seems very manifest to impartial Judges, that the <hi>Covernment</hi> in that Colony is <hi>innocent</hi> as to any <hi>wrongs</hi> that have been done to the Heathen, by those <hi>where the War began.</hi> And therefore for their vindication, and for the satisfaction of those amongst our selves, (or else-where) who are cordially desirous to have things cleared, respecting <hi>the Grounds of the War,</hi> I shall here subjoyn a Letter, which I received from <hi>General Winslow</hi> (whose integrity and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar capacity, (as being Governour of <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony) to give information in this affair is well known) together with a <hi>Narrative of the beginning of these Troubles,</hi> as it was presented to the <hi>Commissioners</hi> of the <hi>Æ²nited Colonies,</hi> in <hi>September</hi> last, for the satisfaction of confederate Brethren.</p>

But Sir, my present design is only to give you further trouble, by enabling you to say something more particularly on our behalf; to that end I have sent you the enclosed Paper, which is an exact Narrative given in by Mr. <hi>Hinkly</hi> and my self, to the first Sessions of the <hi>Commissioners</hi> of the <hi>Confederate Colonies,</hi> September last; from which the <hi>Commissioners</hi> and the <hi>Council</hi> of your Colony, and afterwards your <hi>General Court,</hi> took full satisfaction, as you see by their subsequent acts and actions. Yet much more we can truly say in our Vindication, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that we have endeavoured to carry it justly and faithfully towards them at all times, and friendly beyond their deserts. I think I can clearly say, that before these present troubles broke out, <hi>the English did not possess
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40970:32"/> one foot of Land in this Colony, but what was fairly obtained by honest purchase of the Indian Proprietors:</hi> Nay, because some of our people are of a covetous disposition, and the Indians are in their Streits easily prevailed with to part with their Lands, we first <hi>made a Law that none should purchase or receive of gift any Land of the Indians, without the knowledge and allowance of our Court,</hi> and penalty of a fine, five pound per Acre, for all that should be so bought or obtained. And lest yet they should be streightned, we ordered that <hi>Mount-Hope, Pocasset,</hi> &amp; severall other Necks of the best Land in the Colony, (because most suitable and convenient for them) should never be bought out of their hands, or else they would have sold them long since. And our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours at <hi>Rehoboth</hi> and <hi>Swanzyâ–ª</hi> although they bought their Lands fairly of this <hi>Philip,</hi> and his Father and Brother, yet because of their vicinity, that they might not trespass upon the <hi>Indians,</hi> did at their own cost set up a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry substantial fence quite cross that great Neck between the English and the Indians, and <hi>payed due damage if at any time any unruly horse or other beasts brake in and trespassed.</hi> And for divers years last past (that all occasion of offence in that respect might be prevented) the English agreed with <hi>Philip</hi> and his, for a certain sum yearly to maintain the said Fence, and secure themselves. And <hi>if at any time they have brought complaints before us, they have had justice impartial,</hi> and speedily, so that <hi>our own people</hi> have frequently complained, that <hi>we erred on the other hand, in shewing them overmuch favour.</hi> Much more I might mention, but I would not burden your patience, yet we must own that God is just and hath punished us far less than our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties bave deserved; yea just in using as a Rod, whose enlightning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version we have not endeavoured as we might &amp; should have done, but on the contrary have taught them new sins that they knew not.

                           <p>NOt to look back further then the Troubles that were between the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of <hi>New Plymouth,</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> Sachem of <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> in the Year 1671. It may be remembred, that the settlement and issue of that controversie was obtained and made (principally) by the mediation and interposed advice, and counsel of the other two confederate Colonies, who upon a careful enquiry and search into the grounds of that trouble, found that the said <hi>Sachems</hi> Pretences of wrongs and injuries from that Colony were groundless and false, and that he (although first in Arms) was the peccant offending party, and that <hi>Plimouth</hi> had just cause to take up Arms against him: and it was then agreed that he should pay that Colony a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain summe of Mony, in part of their damage and Charge by him occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and he then not only renewed his ancient Covenant of Friendship with them, but made himself and his Poeople absolute Subjects to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. and to that his Colony of <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> since which time we know not that the English of that, or any other of the Colonies have been injurious to him or his, that might justly provoke them to take up Arms against us: But sometime last winter, the Governour of <hi>Plimouth</hi> was informed, by <hi>Sausaman</hi> a faithful Indian, that the said <hi>Philip</hi> was undoubtedly endeavouring to raise new troubles, and to engage all the <hi>Sachems</hi> round about in War against us. Some of the English also that lived near the said <hi>Sachem,</hi> communicated their fears and jealousies concurrent with what the Indian had informed: About a week after <hi>John Sausaman</hi> had given his Information, he was barbarously Murdered by some Indians, for his faithfulness (as we have cause to believe) to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of God, and of the English. Sometime after <hi>Sausamans</hi> death, <hi>Philip</hi> having heard that the Governour of <hi>Plimouth</hi> had received some informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against him, and purposed to send to him to appear at the next Court, that they might enquire into those Reports, came down of his own accord to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> a little before the Court, in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> last, at which time the Council of that Colony, upon a large debate with him, had great reason to believe that the information against him might be in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance true: But not having proof thereof, and hoping that very discovery of it so far would cause him to desist, they dismist him friendly, giving him only to understand, that if they heard further concerning that matter, they might see reason to demand his Arms to be delivered up for their security,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40970:33"/> (which was according to former agreement between him and them) and he engaged on their demand they should be surrendred to them or their order. At that Court we had many Indians in Examination concerning the Murder of <hi>John Sausaman,</hi> but had not then testimony in the case, but not long after an Indian appearing to testifie, we apprehended three by him charged, to be the Murderers, and secured them, to a tryal at our next Court holden in <hi>June,</hi> at which time, and a little before the Court, <hi>Philip</hi> began to keep his men in Arms about him, and to gather Strangers to him, and to march about in arms towards the upper end of the Neck in which he lived; and near to the English houses, who began thereby to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing disquieted, but took as yet no further notice, but only to set a Military Watch, in the next Towns of <hi>Swanzy</hi> and <hi>Rehoboth.</hi> Some hints we had that <hi>Indians</hi> were in arms, whilst our Court was sitting, but we hoped it might arise from a guilty fear in <hi>Philip,</hi> that we would send for him, and bring him to tryal with the other Murderers, and that if he saw the Court broke up, and he not sent for, the cloud might blow over. And indeed our Innocence made us very secure, and confident it would not have broke into a <hi>War.</hi> But no sooner was our Court dissolved, but we had intelligence from Lieut. <hi>John Brown</hi> of <hi>Swanzy</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> and his men continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly in arms, many strange Indians from several places flocked into him, that they sent away their Wives to <hi>Narraganset,</hi> and were giving our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple frequent Alarms by Drums, and Guns in the night, and had guarded the passages towards <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and that their young Indians were earnest for a War. On the seventh of <hi>June,</hi> Mr. <hi>Benjamin Church</hi> being on Rhode-Island, <hi>Weetamoe</hi> (the <hi>Squaw Sachim</hi> of <hi>Pocasset,</hi>) and some of her chief men told him, that <hi>Philip</hi> intended a War speedily with the English; some of them saying, that they would help him, and that he had already given them leave to kill English-mens Cattle, and rob their Houses. About the 14. and 15th. of <hi>June</hi> Mr. <hi>James Brown</hi> went twice to <hi>Philip</hi> to perswade him to be quiet, but at both times found his Men in arms, and <hi>Philip</hi> very high and not perswadable to peace. On the 14th of <hi>June,</hi> our Council writ an amicable friendly Letter to him, shewing our dislike of his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and advising him to dismiss his strange Indians, and command his own men to fall quietly to their business, that our people might also be quiet, and not to suffer himself to be abused by reports concerning us, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no hurt towards him; but Mr <hi>Brown</hi> could not obtain any Answer from him. On the 17th of <hi>June,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pain</hi> of <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> and several En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish going unarmed to <hi>Mount-Hope</hi> to seek their Horses at <hi>Philips</hi> request, the Indians came and presented their Guns at them, and carried it very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solently, though no way provoked by them. On the 18. or 19th of <hi>June,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40970:34"/> Job Winslow's</hi> House was broke open at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> and rifled by <hi>Philips</hi> men. <hi>June</hi> 20. being Sabbath day, the People of <hi>Swanzy</hi> were Alarmed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, two of our Inhabitants turned out of their Houses, and their Houses rifled, and the Indians were marching up (as they judged) to assault the Town, and therefore intreated speedy help from us. We thereupon, the 21. of <hi>June,</hi> send up some to relieve that Town, and dispatch more with speed. On wednesday 23. of <hi>June</hi> twelve more of their Houses at <hi>Swanzy</hi> were rifled. On the 24th. <hi>Layton</hi> was slain at the Fall River near <hi>Pocasset.</hi> On the 25th of <hi>June,</hi> divers of our people at <hi>Swanzy</hi> were slain, and many Houses burned: until which time, and for several-dayes after, though we had a considerable force there, both of our own, and of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> (to our grief and shame) they took no revenge on the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Thus slow were we and unwilling to engage our selves and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in a War, having many insolencies, almost intolerable, from them, at whose hands we had deserved better;</p>

O our God wilt thou not judge them?</hi> Even so, when <hi>Philip</hi> was in the hands of the <hi>English</hi> in former years, and disarmed by them, they could easily, but would not destroy him and his men. The Governours of that Colony have been as careful to prevent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to him as unto any others; yea, they kept his Land not <hi>from</hi> him, but <hi>for</hi> him, who otherwise would have sold himself out of all; and the Gospel was freely offered to him and to his Subjects, but they despised it: And now behold how they reward us! Will not our God judg them? yea he hath and will do so.</p>

            <p>It raises our admiration for the author to learn at the very beginning of his work that God was a Puritan at heart, and that he gave to the New Englanders the land of the Indians for their rightful possession. This reminds us of the story told elsewhere under Fernandez de Enciso,â€”the only difference being that the gift was made in that case by the Pope to the King of Spain; while in the later instance the Almighty himself stepped in to endow his faithful Puritans with the property of other men.</p>
